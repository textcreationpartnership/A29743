            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THe plauſible outſide and faire cunning dreſs of I. S. his diſcourſe in his Vner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Vnerrable Church,</hi> ſaies our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> in the firſt Page of his Repley, has put him to the trouble of ſearching into its hidden diſeaſes by <hi>Inciſions</hi> and <hi>Diſſections</hi> of <hi>Anatomy:</hi> he has ſpared vs this labor I thank him, the diſtemper of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe appears ſo viſibly in its exterior parts that wee need no <hi>Inciſions</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections</hi> to lay it open: but ſince he has play'd the part of a Chirurgion, let him give me leaue to act that of a Phyſitian and preſent him a Doſs of Pills, which ſhall have nothing of bitterneſs, but what Truth carries with it to ill temper'd Pallats. Thoſe rude expreſſions, <hi>Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, Impudent, Lyar, Impoſtor, Profligatly bold,</hi> and ſuch flouriſhs (wherwith his book is thick ſet) become very well the cauſe he defends, which is of no better <hi>Alloy;</hi> yet it cannot but ſurpriſe me, to ſee him promiſe in his printed ſermon ſuch a gentle temper, challenging only to a ſober exchange of Scripture and
<pb facs="tcp:97770:7"/> reaſon; and in his late book I find him ſo peeuiſh and boyſterous, that he yields to none of his Reformed Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their acuſtomed ſtyle; but Alas! he who broke thofe ſacred tyes which he had to God and his Church; its not to be admired he infringes bonds of a ſmaler ſeyſe: I confeſs I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this coyn is not of our D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; nor yet of any ſchool man of that noble Univerſitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> as ſom do imagin; doubtleſs it muſt have bin fetcht from <hi>Billingsgate;</hi> but our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is to be Blamed for permitting a book ſo filthily worded to be publiſht in his name, without any thing that might be a baite to the attention of an ingenious Reader, but injuries, tales of Popes, Fryars, parities of turnips, rotten ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Spaniſh Proverbs, ſaluting Modeſtie a far of in his 13. Page; <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, o Sacred Laws of Modeſtie,</hi> and this complement being made, he bids Modeſtie <hi>A Dieu,</hi> and no more news of it in all his booke, but rattles and ſcolds beyond meaſure without any thing that reliſhs a ſcholler, or an anſwer to his Antagoniſt; but ſom little words heer and there (like few grains of corn in a
<pb facs="tcp:97770:7"/> heape of chafe) without any connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, or ſenſe, either to enervat his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſari's arguments or eſtabliſh his own Doctrin; that you would think it's ſom old book made to ſom other intent, and a new Title given it, for to make it an anſwer to his Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>And this is the ſtrain of Proteſtant Writers, the vnhappineſs of their cauſe, and the goodneſs of ours being ſuch that they cannot better their own, nor worſe ours, but by paſſion in lieu of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and invectives and calumnies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of ſolid arguments; in which art the two late Champions which Ireland has given to the Church of England, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>Sall,</hi> do ſo excell, that none but the firſt could parallell the ſecond: and I cannot but admire the particular ſtudy which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sall</hi> ſeems to make of tredding the footſteps of the other, as if he did ſtriue, to copy out his actions; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Egan</hi> caſt of his habit and became a Proteſtant; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sall</hi> ſoon after did as much; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>But tho he be very bitter all along in his book, in no where does his iraſcible facultie appear ſo ſharpe edged as in the defence of his imaginary Titles of <hi>Profeſſor of Divinity</hi> in <hi>Tudela</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia</hi> in Spain; Lector of <hi>Moral Divinity</hi> in the Royal Colledge of <hi>Salamanca; Profeſſor of Controverſies</hi> in the Iriſh Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Salamanca:</hi> He will prove me a <hi>Lyar,</hi> and a <hi>Profligatly bold Impoſtor</hi> for diſputing him theſe Titles; and how? marry by an Epigram made to his praiſe by a Prince; By <hi>Teſtimonial Letters</hi> of the great credit he had in Spain; by a <hi>Letter</hi> of a Venerable Prelat written in his commendation, and by a Lycence vnder the Inquiſitor General's hand for
<pb facs="tcp:97770:8"/> to reade prohibited books, in quality of a Lector of Controverſies in the Iriſh Colledge. I beſeech you good Reader aſk him has he kept the teſtimonial let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his <hi>Prieſtly Ordination;</hi> it's a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one if he has not loſt them; but the teſtimonial letters of his great credit and empty Titles he has care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſeru'd. But that you may ſee how farr he is from proving me a <hi>Lyar,</hi> and a <hi>Profligatly bold Impoſtor;</hi> remember, I pray, what he advanced in his printed, Sermon and obſerve what his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial letters import.</p>
            <p>In his Sermon he told vs he was <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Controverſies in the Iriſh Colledge and his Auditory were Spaniards, french and Iriſh:</hi> will not any who reads this, and knows not the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> humor, conceive that this <hi>Profeſſorſhip</hi> of Controverſies was ſom public imployment, attended by ſo great an Auditory? I replyed there was no profeſſor of Controverſies in the Iriſh Colledge with Spaniſh and french Auditors; and this I do again auerr, and will prove it; for I do not deny but that either he, who is there in the office of <hi>Rector,</hi> or ſom other Ieſuit who lives with him, (commonly he is alone) has
<pb facs="tcp:97770:9"/> the Title and name of <hi>Lector</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies; but this is but an empty Title, (as the Duke of Lorrain is called <hi>King of Ieruſalem,)</hi> and never yet had any other exerciſe, but to teach half a douzen lads, Collegians of the Colledge; and this very ſlender exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe itſelf, it has it but very ſeldom; but never yet was it ſeen, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that any extern Schoolars either Spaniards, french, or Iriſh ſhould enter into the Colledge to be taught: as I write this I receive a letter from the Rector of the Iriſh Colledge of Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca, a Man of credit for his virtue and learning; he writes thus in anſwer to my letter. <hi>Some time there has bin in this Colledge the Title of Profeſſor of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, but a meer Title without any exerciſe, becauſe the imployment of that Perſon, was only to repaſs and expound to the youth of the Colledge, their Dictats, which they write in ſchoole; nor was it ever permitted that any extern ſchollar ſhould com into the Colledge to be taught, but only the Domeſtic Schollars of the houſe: ſomtimes perhaps, he that was in that imployment did reade ſom leſson out of Bellarmin or Becan, which Mr Sall might have don; but as for to have bin Profeſſor of
<pb facs="tcp:97770:9"/> Moral Divinity in the Royal Colledge of this town; ther's no ſuch thing; for there was never yet any Profeſſor of Moral Divinity in it: as for to be Lector of Divinity in Tudela and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia; in Tudela there never was any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity taught; but there is there a Maſter of Caſes of Conſcience, whoſe Auditory never exceeds the number of four or fiue, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he has none: in Palencia ther's no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity taught that euer I could hear of.</hi> Thus goes the letter from the Iriſh Colledge of Salamanca, and you may ſee, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall's cenſure againſt I S. of <hi>Profligat bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneſs</hi> and a <hi>Lyar,</hi> has more of good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh than of truth and common civility.</p>
            <p>His teſtimonial letters of his great credit prove juſt nothing; for Example, a Prince forſooth made an Epigram in his praiſe; ſuppoſe that be true; what then? do not wee all know the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Poets and Painters? a Prelat baniſht, meets him in Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plona in Spain, and expecting he might be of ſom ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or comfort vnto him in that ſtrange Country, he writes in his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what he would have him write, and he thought might availe for to ſtop him there; what does all that amount vnto? That the Prelat was deſirous to
<pb facs="tcp:97770:10"/> haue a friend and Country man in that Citty; and ſeeing him teaching Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without any further examin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him a brave man: His lycence vnder the Inquiſitor General's hand for reading heretical books as being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Controverſies; proves, at moſt, that he had that Title; but ſaies nothing of the exerciſe of it; which was no more but to be a <hi>Pedagogue,</hi> as wee have ſaid, to half a douzen Collegians, and ſaies nothing of the Spaniſh and french Auditorie: Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> tells vs there are <hi>Several Ieſuits now living in Ireland, who were Students in Divinity, when he was a Profeſſor of Moral Theologie and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Salamanca, who did ſee him ſit with the other Lectors of Divinity examining yearly their ſufficiency for promotion.</hi> Never did man ſpeake leſs truth and with more courage; had not misfortune fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or at leaſt delayed our hopes, of ſeeing that witty Treatiſe entituled <hi>Haudkins Letters,</hi> the product of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit judgment, and of a no leſs learned man; we ſhould have an exact and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant account of the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>^'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and credit in ſpain: but ſince he has cited ſom Jeſuits now living in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb facs="tcp:97770:10"/> for ſpectators of his glorie in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanca; I will declare what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and I have that ſatisfaction of their truth and ſinceritie, that I am ſure they would not for any paſſion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſe vpon me, or diminiſh of any mans credit: two of them knew him in Salamanca, and ſo far from ſhoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Lectors of Divinity in the Royal Colledge, that his credit did not reach to be thought worthy, to carrie their bookes; never was he of ſo much credit as to be either invited or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to argue, as much as in their Domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Theſes; never was there any Moral Divinitie taught in the Royal Colledge; nor Controverſies in the Iriſh Colledge but as we mentioned before; never was he a Coexaminator with the other Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Divinitie, but in one occaſion, that ſome Lectors of Divinitie being abſent in the time of examen, they honored the Charge of Rector of the Iriſh Colledge which he had, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to be one of the Examinators: and if of this little accidentarie ſubſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution he be ſo full, as to reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the Examinators, and to cope with the Lectors of Divinitie of
<pb facs="tcp:97770:11"/> that Royal Colledge; likly, if at any time, ſome one did conſult him in a caſe of Conſcience, when he was in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanca is all the ground he has, for to call himſelf, <hi>Lector of Moral Theologie</hi> in the Royal Colledge; and by this Rule, if he has heard any on's Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in ſpain, he might haue called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Confeſſor General of Spain</hi> with as much reaſon as his friend <hi>Egan</hi> ſtiles himſelf <hi>Confeſſor General of Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But will you ſee how this man, who ſo mightily magnifies himſelf, ſpeakes of others; not well, to be ſure; for ſelf admirers, are ordinarily deſpiſers of others: in his 5. chap. he touchs that ridiculous Conſecration of his firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Biſhops at the <hi>Nags-head Tavern in Cheapſide,</hi> and ſaies, it's a ſlanderous fable invented by Papiſts, long ſince refuted, and lately revived by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a greate calling, to his ſhame and confuſion; being convicted of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by B. Bramhal: And dare you, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, to charge a Perſon of ſo great a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with impoſtures? a Perſon of ſo knowen honor and reputation, with ſhame and confuſion? if, to have given ſignal teſtimonies of his Duty to his
<pb facs="tcp:97770:11"/> exiled Soveraign in the moſt renowned Courts of the world; if, to have the whole Royal family for Panegyriſts of his Loyaltie and good ſervices, be a ſhame; you may accuſe him of it: if, to have had Rome and Portugal for admirers of his Wit and learning; if, to have given to the world many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Treatiſes; if, to have been the only man named in the laſt proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the baniſhment of Prelates and Regulars be a confuſion, and not a proof of his merit, that he was ſingl'd out, as the <hi>David</hi> of our Camp; if this be a confuſion, you may charge him with it: if to be honored and eſteemed by the beſt of Catholics and Proteſtants; and hated by none, but by the worſe of both, be a ſhame and confuſion; you may charge him with it: if to have been eſteemed and aplauded in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, wherof he was once a Member, and from which nothing, but an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable neceſſitie of the Church, and king's ſervice could ſeparate him; which he no ſooner performed, and the Charge he now has, was offered him; but he religiouſly ſacrific'd that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent charge in the hands of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb facs="tcp:97770:12"/> to God, earneſtly aſking to return to that Communitie; which was denied moſt prudently, becauſe it was knowen his Eminent Talents would ſhine with more luſte to the glorie of God, and benefit of the Church in that great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, than in a priuat life; if you call this a ſhame and confuſion, you may charge him with it; but to call his convincing diſcourſe of the Nullity of your Clergy, his ſhame and confuſion, and your B. Bramhal's weake Repley a conuiction of his impoſtures, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your judgment, to be an injuſt ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of what is honorable, glorious, judicious and wittie.</p>
            <p>And truly you have given no ſmale teſtimonie of this, in that great Title you give your Booke; <hi>The Catholic Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic Church and faith of England:</hi> as you hope to be ſaved, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, did not you laugh, when you were writing that Title; if the frights of a byaſs'd conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience can permit you to laugh? when firſt I viewed it, and met in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpice of the book, <hi>The Theater of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> I thought it was a Comedy acted in that Univerſitie; but ſince that he will have it paſs for a ſerious diſcourſe
<pb facs="tcp:97770:12"/> of Religion, wee muſt demonſtrat how ill qualified his Church is for to carrie ſo glorious à Title; and tho this has been ſufficiently evidenc't in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe, and my arguments in no wiſe anſwered; yet I will again ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the truth in this Rejoynder, that my impartial Reader will I hope be convinc't that the Roman Catholic Religion: is the true Catholic, Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic Religion; and that Chriſt has no Church on earth, if there be not an Unerring Unerrable Church, and as I, to ſhun a tedious repetition of what I formerly ſaid, do omit the ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of my former book, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly prove the points heer hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſo I hope my Reader for to be fully ſatisfied, will not be content with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Treatiſe, but will alſo caſt an eye vpon the former: As neither paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion nor prejudice has any ſhare in my intention, ſo I hope my Reader will lay both aſide in the peruſal of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, which aime at nothing but his ſpiritual advantage, as being</p>

            <p>In his 2. Chapt: againſt N.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts of thoſe creeds; therefore the Church and faith of England is truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97770:14"/> Apoſtolic:</hi> for, ſaies he pag: 17. <hi>if the contents of thoſe Creeds vvere ſufficient to gain the name of Catholic Apoſtolic to the Ancient Chürch, firſt ſo called; vvhy ſhould not they be ſufficient to make a Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Apoſtolic in all other ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The weakneſs of this diſcours is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc't by a cleer inſtance. In the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dayes, when there was no creed but theirs, the faith then taught was the ſyſtem of Articles contained in that creed; the Church was then Catholic Apoſtolic by belieuing the contents of it; in what euer Church that Doctrin and faith was taught, that Church was truly Catholic Apoſtolic; but when in ſucceeding ages the four firſt General Councils delivered their Creeds and declared ſom Verities oppoſed by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics; to be reuealed Truths; then for to be a Catholic Apoſtolic Church, it was not ſufficient to belieue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Apoſtles Creed, but it was needfull to belieue the contents of the four Councils Creeds: Obſerve I pray Reader, that all Heretics will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue their own Church to be Catholic Apoſtolic by our Doctors diſcours, for (ſay the Arrians, Neſtorians and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97770:15"/> wee belieue the contents of the Apoſtles creed, which alone, before any Council of Nice, Conſtantinople, &amp;c. gained the name of Catholic Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic to the Church in the Apoſtles da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies; and ſay they, <hi>indeed it muſt appeur ſtrange</hi> (they are your own wonds pag: 17.) <hi>to any impartial man that the ſyſtem of Articles contained in that Creed, vvhich gained the name of Catholic Apoſtolic to the Church, firſt ſo called in the Apoſtles dayes, ſhould not be ſufficient to make a Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic in all times.</hi> This is your argument, Doctor which the <hi>Arrians, Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Neſtoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> borrow from you to proue their Churchs and faiths to be Catholic and Apoſtolic, as well as yours: does it proue them to be ſuch, or not? if not; nor does it proue your Church to be Catholic Apoſtolic: you muſt anſwer them, as wee anſwer you; that in the Apoſtles daies vntill the four firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, the ſyſtem of Articles contained in the Apoſtles Creed was ſufficient to give the name of Catholic Apoſtolic to the Church which belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them; but when afterward the Church by its General Councils decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red other Verities oppoſed by Heretics,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97770:15"/> to be reuealed Truths; then for to gain the name of Catholic Apoſtolic Church, it was not ſufficient to belieue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Apoſtles Creed, but it was requiſit alſo to belieue thoſe Verities declared by the Councils to be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Truths, tho not expreſſed in the Apoſtles Creed: euen ſo wee ſay to you; tho the Apoſtles and four firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils creeds were once ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to giue the name of Catholic Apoſtolic; but after that new declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made of other Verities by ſucceeding Councils; for to gain the name of Catholic Apoſtolic, its not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to belieue the contents of thoſe Creeds but that wee muſt belleve all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities propoſed to vs by the Church in ſucceeding ages and Councils to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed Truths: And this our Doctor cannot gainſay, for pag. 60. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that Inferiour Verities are not contained in the Creeds; and yet are to be explicitly belieued whenever wee are aſcertained that they are reuealed Truths.</p>
            <p>In the 8. Chapt. of the <hi>Venerring Vner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Church, and in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapt. of this Treatiſe I proue the Doctrin of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97770:16"/> Proteſtancy (as condiſtinct from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciſm) to be but meer <hi>Probable</hi> Doctrin; (Read I pray thoſe Chapters) but its evident that the Doctrin contained in thoſe Creeds, nor the Doctrin belieued by the Ancient Church, which gained it the name of <hi>Catholic Apoſtolic,</hi> is not <hi>Probable</hi> Doctrin; therefore its evident that the Proteſtant Doctrin, as condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Catholeciſm, is neiher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in thoſe Creeds nor was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Ancient Catholic Apoſtolic Church. The Ancient Church belieued S. Peter and his ſucceſſors ſupremacy, as I will proue in the 14. chap. of this Treatiſe; they believed the Canon of Scripture (whither this, or that; it matters not for the preſent) they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Sacrements) if two, or ſeaven I will not diſpute now) their <hi>Matter, form,</hi> and <hi>effects;</hi> you believe <hi>Figuratiue Preſence; the Kings ſupremacy; Communion in both Kinds;</hi> and not à ſyllable of all theſe in the Creeds; how can you then, affirm that all the Doctrin believed by the Ancient Church firſt called <hi>Catholic Apoſtolic,</hi> is contained in the Creeds?</p>
            <p>In his 3. c. ther's nothing worth the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of, but two groſs calumnies;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97770:16"/> the one that Bellarmin l. 3. de Eccleſia. c. 20. (and that book has but 17 chapt) teachs, that to be a member of the Church, it's ſufficient to profeſs exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly, without any interiour Aſſent, the Popiſh Doctrin and ſupremacy: the ſecond is againſt two Popes, <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth; that they ſhould haue offered to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to ratify the <hi>Reformation,</hi> if ſhe did own their Supremacy, and them to be the Authors of the Reformation: ſuch a ridiculous ſtory could neuer be better couched than in our Doctor's book. Yes indeed; the Pope would becom a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant to currie favor with Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> and make the Emperour, the Kings of Spain, and France, and all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Princes his Enemies? the Pope would becom a Proteſtant, for to get a Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopric, or Penſion from Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth (for this is all he could expect, if perhaps he did not expect to marrie her) and forfeit his Popedom; for à Pope who becoms an Heretic loſes his Dignitie and reuenews: and can it ſink into any mans brains but of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sall, that an Italian would make ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change?</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97770:17"/>
            <p>His 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> chap. has as little of ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce as his 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> ſom few fragments of Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez his Doctrin, without any anſwer, but, <hi>Hovv. can Suarez make this out</hi> &amp;c. Suarez proues irreſiſtably that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant faith, where with they belieue the contents of the Creeds, is no Divin faith for true Catholic Apoſtolic faith, muſt be an infallible undoubted Aſſent; Proteſtants can have no ſuch, wheras they haue no vndoubted infallible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or ground to reſt their aſſent vpon, as I haue largely and conuincingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the <hi>Vnerring Vnerrable Church</hi> and in the 10. chap. of this Treatiſe.</p>

            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to maintain by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge the Royal Diadem, which by iniuſtice ſhe vſurped againſt the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right of the family of the <hi>Stuarts;</hi> recalled the Reformation, which Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had baniſht from the land; and pereiving the <hi>Prelatic</hi> Portie of it, was the moſl vſefull for her ends; ſhe reſolued to have Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, and named for that dignity, <hi>Parker, Horn, Grindal Ievvel, Scory</hi> and others: No Proteſtant Biſhops Biſhops o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>f Henry the VIII. and Edward the VI. were then aliue; that ſpurious Race of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy hauing ended in <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> executed in Queen Maries time for Hereſie and Treaſon: and our new elected Biſhops were <hi>Non pluſt</hi> for to be conſecrated; becauſe no Catholic Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop would vndertake it: their firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs was to <hi>Richard Creagh.</hi> Lord Primat of Armagh, then Priſoner in the Tower of London, offering him his releaſe if he did lay his hands on them; but he religiouſly preferred an innocent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment to ſo criminal a liberty.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97770:18"/> Then they addreſſed themſelues to B: <hi>Landaff,</hi> a Walſh B: who at their firſt on ſett, gave ſom marks of flexibility; but <hi>Bonner</hi> B: of London threatning to excommunicat him if he attempted any ſuch thing in his Dioceſs; he would not yield to their importunity; they lead him to the <hi>Nags-head</hi> Tauern at <hi>Cheapſide</hi> in London, with a deſign to put him in a merry humor, and thereby to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him: but they came ſhort of their expectation. <hi>Scory,</hi> a reſolut blade, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing danted at this repuls, reſolued not to let ſlip a Biſhopric for want of Popiſh Ceremonies: <hi>vvhat,</hi> quoth he? <hi>do they think vvee cannot be Bishops if vvee be not greas'd?</hi> (alluding to the Chriſm, where with Biſhops are anoynted.) and commanding Parker and his Camerades to kneel, bid them; <hi>Get vp lord Biſhorps of England:</hi> and this was that famous Conſecration of the Nags-head Tauern in Cheapſide; without any other <hi>Keyes</hi> but thoſe of a <hi>Tavern,</hi> nor any Chriſm but à glaſs of Wine. This is no new ſtory, like that of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>Now wee will demonſtrat that this paſſage is true, and no invention of Papiſts as our Doctor pretends; and that the Proteſtant Biſhops were not other wiſe ordained, than as is related.

               <hi>Kelliſſon Fitsſimons</hi> and the reſt of our Catholic Prelats, and Authors, who liued in <hi>Parkers</hi> time, and ſuffered ſo much for their Religion and conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, induce the whole Church, by misinformation and impoſtures to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain your Miniſters converted had they not aſſurance that your Parker and Aſſociats Ordination was Null and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Nor are wee Roman Catholics only who pleade againſt this Nullity: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in the long Parliament, the Bishops were excluded out of the houſe of Lords; and an Independant Lord made a ſpeech to proue that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to be juſt, becauſe the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Bishops were no true Bishops for want of Ordination. Remember the <hi>Püritans</hi> reproach againſt your Church, that <hi>the profane Order and conſecration of Proteſtant Biſhops had its beginning in a corner:</hi> Do they allude think you to the Chappel of <hi>Lambeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or to the <hi>Nags-head</hi> Tavern? looke with an impartial eye vpon this whole diſcours, and if paſſion does not prodigiouſly blind you, you will confeſs, the Nags-head ſtory to be no more ridiculous than true; your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97770:26"/> Conſecration to haue been without <hi>any impoſition of hands;</hi> and conſequently Null; and wheras all your Prelats de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue their <hi>caracter</hi> from <hi>Parker</hi> and his Aſſociats, your Clergy is but a Mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and your Bishops but laymen with Rockets.</p>
            <p>But our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is reſolved to be quits with vs, ſince that wee have made his Bishops <hi>Leymen,</hi> he will not reſt till he dethrones our Popes: Not one true Pope does he grant vs ſince Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the XIII. The Elections of all the ſubſequent were quite Null: this is a rare and new diſcouerie: but he ſaies it's not new; for he ſaies it was made long ſince by a learned pen, à Roman Catholic, (he does not name him) who preſented à book to king James, and by him to the reſt of the Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhewing the neceſſity of gathering a Council againſt Paul the V. the Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of whoſe Election, and of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors he pretends to proue; and our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> makes it a convincing argument of the ſtrength and truth of this book, that it was never anſwered by any of our Church; and I think its rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding argument of the <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97770:26"/> frivolouſneſs of the book (if any ſuch book was) that no Catholic Author did think it worth his labour to anſwer it: and if that book did make out, or with any appeerance of reaſon did ſhew the Nullity of the Elections of thoſes Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and particularly of Paul the V. then living, I know none to whom it would be more wellcom than to ſom ambitious Cardinal, who in hopes of getting the <hi>Tiara</hi> for himſelf would pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize and publish it: But when, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many enemies the Popes haue in England, to advance any thing that might be to his deſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, wee ſee, that that book was in its firſt birth ſo little applauded, that it never deſerued to peep out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, for ought wee know; that it neuer deſerued any anſwer from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, nor yet to haue been in any great Vogue among Proteſtants; this indeed is ſufficient to perſwade vs, that the book, if any ſuch has been, had as little of ſubſtance, as the author of it had of wit and Religion.</p>
            <p>For was the man in his Wits, or what an opinion did he expect could the world haue of his Religion, who went
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97770:27"/> to a Ptoteſtant king for to haue a Council conuen'd againſt the Pope? could it ſink into his brains, if he had any, that a Proteſtant Prince could be ſo fit an inſtrument for that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; as the Emperour, the kings of France and Spain, or ſom Catholic Monarch? This is the Book, and this book and Author is the warrant our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> giues you for all the clutter he keeps in many leaues he ſpends in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Nullity, forſooth, of our Popes; and if the book itſelf deſerued no anſwer, much leſs do the fragments of it copied out by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall deſerue any.</p>
            <p>To his 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Chap. he prefixes this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; <hi>The Vaſt extent of Chriſtian Religion Profeſſed in the Church of England;</hi> and in four long Chapters he runs vpon the Sects in England, Holland France, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ruſſia, and what part not of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; nay he reckons vp all the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic's of <hi>Greece,</hi> and all theſe he ſaies, are <hi>of the Religion profeſſed in the Church of England.</hi> And is not the Religion of the Church of England a monſtruous Body that is compoſed of ſo many members, and ſo deformed? be a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteran
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97770:27"/> be a Lutheran, be a Quaker, be a Seeker, be what you will, ſo you be not a Roman Catholic; you are of the Religion of the Church of England. Reade I pray the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe where I proue out of the D<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> own Conceſſions that theſe Sects are Hereſies; reade alſo the 8. Chap. of my former Treatiſe of the <hi>Vnerring Vnerrable Church,</hi> where I convincingly proued that ſince the Roman Catholic faith is a true ſaving faith, as the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland confeſſes; and that there is but one ſaving faith as S. Paul ſaies; any Church of faith which differs from her in any Article or Doctrin, euen thoſe which yee call <hi>Inferior Truths,</hi> muſt be an Heretical and heterodox Church and faith, which if you had well read, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, and vnderſtood well, you would not haue troubled vs again with this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Doctrin, <hi>of ſaluation in any Chriſtian Society;</hi> or you ſhould haue been ſo juſt to your Adverſary as to anſwer to his diſcours vpon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but I ſee you deſignedly ſtep aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de wheneuer you find yourſelf <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I read this Paradox of our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97770:28"/> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I jndged the Catholic and Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church to be perfectedly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the two Women conteſting about the living Child before <hi>Salomon;</hi> ſhee who was the true Mother would not haue the Child devided, but to live entire and vndeuided; ſhee who was not the true Mother would haue him devided and ſhared betwixt both: <hi>Salomon</hi> adjudged the Child to her who would not conſent to that inhuman di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; ſhe was the true Mother: This is our caſe; the Controverſy is, which is the true Religion and faith; the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church cannot endure to hear of any diviſion of the Church and faith of Chriſt into many oppoſit Sects; ſhe will haue but one Congregation vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly profeſſing One Doctrin, One Lyturgy, Rites and Ceremonies; The Proteſtant Church by the mouth of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, and other Writers cry out, <hi>Dividatur Infans; neither yee Catholics alone, nor wee Proteſtants only, nor any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grcgation ſeparatly from the other, is the Church and faith of Chriſt; each muſt haue ashare; the faith of Chriſt is deuided betwixt vs:</hi> Is not the Catholic Church think you to be judged the true Mother of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97770:28"/> the faithfull, which deteſts this Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diviſion of the faith of Chriſt into ſo many Sects? and are not Sectaries to be eſteemed Tyrants, who rent and teare it into ſo many peeces?</p>
            <p>But I cannot omit a notorious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of our D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> in his 12. chapt. where magnifying the great power and extent of his Proteſtant Religion in ſeueral kingdoms, he coms to ſpeak of <hi>France; In France ſaies he, thoſe of the Religion haue 70 towns with Garriſons of ſoldiers gouerned by Nobles and Gentlemen of the Proteſtant Religion: they haue 800 Miniſters who retain Penſion out of the public Finance and are ſo diſperſed throughout the kingdom, that in the Principalites of Orange and Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou, allmoſl all the inhabitants; a in Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony the one half; in Languedoc Normandy and the Weſtern Prouinces a ſtrong party profeſſes the Proteſtant Religion; beſides the Caſtles and forts belonging to the Duke of Bullon, Count of Naual, Duke of Trimoulle Monſiour de Chaſtillon, Mareſhal de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiers, Duke de Sully and others.</hi> When I read this peece of <hi>Romance</hi> in our D<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> book I turned preſently to the frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice of it, to ſee in what year it was printed, for I ſuſpected it might haue
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97770:29"/> been in king Henry the fourth's time, when indeed the Hugonots were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull; but finding it was printed the year 1676. I admired the Authors Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and inſincerity in beguiling his Reader.</p>
            <p>For not one town, garriſon, fort, or Caſtle, haue the Hugonots in Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce this day; not one Miniſter which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Penſion out of the <hi>Finance</hi> but liues by the gratuity and alms of their Flock, as our Clergy in Ireland: It is true the Hugonots are more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the Prouince of Poitou, than in any other in France, but to ſay, that almoſt all the Inhabitans are Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots; its agreat impoſture: I declare what I ſee, and what I hear from french men as well Catholics as Hugonots, that there is not one Hugonot for a hundred Catholics in that Prouince; about <hi>Nyort, S. Maixance, Fontenée, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian,</hi> and all along from Poitiers to Rochel, the moſt part of the Gentry who liue in the Country are Hugonots; but of the common People and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the towns, the Catholics are incomparably more numerous: The Dukes of Bullon, Rouan, Trimoulle &amp;c.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97770:29"/> which he reckons as Hugonots, are all Roman Catholics; nay for our D<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> comfort, let him know, that there is not one, of the Prime families of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce this day a Hugonot exceptone, that's the <hi>Count de Ruſste,</hi> a Cadet of the houſe of <hi>Rochfoucaut:</hi> Of the Nobility of the ſecond rank, there are ſom; neither is there any Hugonot this day in France of any Vogue, either in the Court, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or civil government except Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſhal de <hi>Zumbert,</hi> who is no French man. By this you may judge what little credit our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> deſerues in what he tells vs of the vaſt power, and extent of his Brethren Sectaries in Poland, Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania Ruſſia &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He moſt groſly abuſes his Reader in telling him the Greek Church agrees with Proteſtants in oppoſing Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation Purgatory &amp;c. againſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; for in Luthers time, when <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Patriark of Conſtantinople vnderſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tood that Luther boaſted, his Doctrin was profeſſed by the Greek Church; the ſaid Patriark aſſembled a Council of the Greek Prelats, and ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt, and condemned Luthers Errors; declared they belieued Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97770:30"/> Purgarory, Prayers to Saints &amp;c. as Rome did: and the Acts and Decrees of this Council were printed and publisht by the Patriark himſelf, whoſe book is extant in many Libraries in France, and elſwhere: and about ten years agon by occaſion of a diſpute betwixt Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> a Hugonot Miniſter; the Miniſter obſtinatly auerring, that the Greek Church and other Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics in the Turkiſh Dominions denyed Tranſubſtantiation and other Catholic Tenets; Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> procured by means of the french Embaſſador in Conſtantinople an authentic public De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration from the Patriark and Prelats of the Greek Church and other Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, declaring Vnanimouſly their belief of Tranſubſtantiation and other Tenets of the Church of Rome, which Declaration is common in France, to be read in Monſieur Arnaud's booke <hi>De la Perpetuité de la Foy &amp;c.</hi> ſo that tho the Grecians be Schiſmatics, its appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent their Doctrin of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Purgatory and other Tenets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted betwixt vs and Proteſtants, is the ſame with that of Rome.</p>

            <p>From his 16<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Chap. to the end of his firſt part he has nothing worthy of any Reflexion but a diſcourſe of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, which wee will examin in our 15. and 16.

He runs much vpon the vnlawfullneſs of Subjects raiſing Armes againſt their Prince; and I wiſh he could print this Doctrin deeply in his fellow Sectaries hearts; but he will not perſwade them ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a truth (as I will proue in the II Chapt. vntill the Church of England giues her Profeſſors an other Rule of faith, and not Scripture arbitrarily interpreted, belieued and practis'd as each one vnderſtands it, without any ſubmiſſion to a ſupream Paſtor from whom wee muſt receiue the true ſenſe of it.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Chriſtian Sects, ſaies our Doctor to his Mecae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas are joyned with the Church of England; they haue all but one and the ſame faith; and that faith profeſſed by that louely Company is the Primitive Catholic Apoſtolic faith; they differ ſaies he Chap. 12. againſt N. N. only in Rites and Ceremonies; and there is not one of theſe Sects but is as different from the other, and exclaim againſt one an other as much as againſt Popery:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97770:32"/> aſk the Presbiterians what they think of Proteſtancie? they ſay, its Popery in Engliſh; aſk the Quakers their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them both? they are Limbs of Satan: aſk the Anabaptiſts what they judge of all three? they are Children of Perdition.</p>
               <p>But I pray D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> what is the faith of the Church of England as to the Canon of Scripture? it belieues S Pauls Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Hebrews, the Epiſtles of Iames and Jude, the ſecond and third of S. John, and the 2. of S. Peter to be true Canonical Scripture; and what is the Lutherans of Germani's faith as to this point? that they are not Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: and is this difference but in Rites and Ceremonies? does not the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church belieue the Adoration of the conſecrated Hoſt, and the vſe and prayers before Images to be downright Idolatry; and Lutherans ſay its not? and do you make but a Ceremony of Idolatry? does not the Proteſtant Church belieue the firgurative only Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Lutherans belieue the Real preſence, which you ſay is an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror inconſiſtent with Salvation? and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97770:32"/> is this but a Ceremonie? or will God condemn men for a meer Ceremonie? does not the Church of England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Neceſſity of both kinds in the Communion, and the Hugonots of France in their Eccleſiaſtical Diſciplin ch. 12. art. 7. deny it, and ſay it may for juſt reaſons be giuen in bread alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne? This is no Ceremonial difference betwixt your Church and ours; for its, you ſay, one of our Errors inconſiſtent with ſaluation; and why it ſhould be a Ceremonial buſineſs betwixt Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and Hugonots I know not: Nor are the Proteſtant Bishops of England ſo prodigal of their Eccleſiaſtical reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news as to ſay that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is but a Ceremony which they belieue to be de <hi>Iure Divino</hi> and the Presbiterians deny it: ſee you Reader with what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of truth our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> can ſay that the Church of England and the other Sects are joyned in one faith.</p>
               <p>O! but, ſaies he ch. 12. againſt N. N. they all agree in the chief heads and fundamental points of Chriſtianity; and what be they? Bleſſed be God, that inſpired to our good D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to tell vs what be thoſe fundamental points and chief
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97770:33"/> Articles wherin Proteſtant Writers do ſo often tell vs that all muſt agree for to haue true faith; and that all other points are but inferior Truths, Rites and Ceremonies: Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> then tells vs the chief heads and fundamental points of Chriſtianity neceſſary to Salvarion; The Holy Scripture; the ſacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Perſon of the Son of God, God and man; The Providence of God, ſin, free will, the Law, the Ghoſpell, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Chriſt; faith in his name; Regeneration; The Catholic Church, and ſupream head of it, Chriſt; The Sacraments, their number and vſe; The ſtate of Souls after death; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and life Etetnal; theſe are the chief heads and Subſtantial points and in theſe all the Reformed Churchs agree with that of England, ſaies our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> in that 12. Chapt. againſt N. N.</p>
               <p>But my Reader will not I hope be ſo eaſily perſwaded of this aggreement betwixt theſe Sectaries, euen in theſe Chief heads and fundamental points: for the Proteſtants belieue S. Pauls Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Hebrews and the other Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles mentioned but now, to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture; the Lutherans vtterly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97770:33"/> deny them: The Lutherans in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Lypſia, the Magdeburgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the Lutheran Divins in the Conference of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> belieue Seauen Sacraments; nor do they agree in the <hi>vſe of the Sacraments</hi> for the Hugonots of France as I obſerved, belieue the Lords ſupper may be taken in one kind, the Church of England belieues it muſt neceſſarily be taken in both; in their Doctrin of Gods Providence they are all alſo far aſunder; for not only the Gomariſts in Holland following the Doctrin of Calvin, but alſo many Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot Churchs in France belieue that antecedently to any good or bad work of man, God has created and abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Decreed ſom men to be eternally damn'd and others to be ſaved; the Church of England, the Arminians in Holland and many Hugonots of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce deny this cruel decree in God, and belieue none is damn'ed by Gods abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut Will and decree, but for his fins. You ſee Reader how the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and other Sectaries are at ears not only in Rites and Ceremonies; not only in Inferior and not Fundamental Articles, but euen in thoſe which our
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97770:34"/> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> himſelf calls the chief points, and Fundamental Heads of Chriſtianity: How can our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſay they are all joyned in one faith? or how can he ſay the faith profeſſed in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and in the other Sects is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Apoſtolic faith; if he will not ſay that one Apoſtle taught and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued two Sacraments as the Proteſtants do; and an other Apoſtle Seaven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments as the Lutherans of Lypſia and Ratiſbon did; one Apoſtle taught that ſuch Epiſtles were Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and an other belieued they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not.</p>
               <p>But D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> do not you confeſs that the Church of England differs from Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Preſbiterians and other Sects in inferior and not Fundamental Verities? and no true Proteſtant of England who vnderſtands well his Catechiſm will ſay that Proteſtants and Catholics differ in more than in Inferior Verities; what greater Vnion then can you pretend with Lutherans and other Sectaries than with vs Catholics? moreouer Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor you ſay that errors againſt theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Verities are inconſiſtent with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation if ignorance does not excuſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97770:34"/> them; your Brethren Sectaries therefore will be as Deep in hell as Catholics, Becauſe they hold errors againſt your Inferior Verities as well as Catholics; and if they haue ignorance it muſt be <hi>groſs, Willfull</hi> and <hi>obſtinatly blind,</hi> as that of Papiſts becauſe they haue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which you ſay, plainly declares your Doctrin to any that is not <hi>willfully and obſtinatly blind:</hi> laſtly D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> you ſay in your Dedicatory that <hi>the true nature of Hereſy conſiſts in Doctrin oppoſit to Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:</hi> but all the Doctrin that Lutherans, Preſbiterians &amp;c. hold in oppoſition to your Doctrin of England, is quite and plainly oppoſit to Scripture; becauſe you tell vs a thouſand times ouer both in your Sermon, and in your Book that your Doctrin of Proteſtancy, figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Preſence, Communion in both kinds two Sacraments &amp;c. is plainly ſetdown, and ſeen in Scripture to any that is not <hi>willfully blind;</hi> therefore the reſt of Sectaries, (who deny your inferior Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities) faith and Religion is plain Hereſy: behold Reader the faith and Religion wherin the Church of England and the reſt of Sectaries are joyned.</p>
               <p>Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> goes on in his Dedicatory
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97770:35"/> Epiſtle, and tells his Mecaenas that the Proteſtant Curhch and other Sectaries are Reformed Churches; that the faith of the Church of Rome was once praiſed throughout the World; its his and the Reformed Churches wiſh, he ſaies, that wee may return to our primitive luſtre and joyn hart and hand with them to the edification and encreaſe of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity; But they being ſo ſeparated and diuided in Doctrin among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as wee haue ſhowen; its impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to joyn with them vntill they agree among themſelues, and tell vs with which of them ſhall wee joyn; for with whatever Sect of them wee joyn, wee ſhall haue all the reſt on our backs, and ſo neuer be at reſt: the Preſbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians will neuer conſent that wee joyn with Proteſtants; nor the Proteſtants will neuer condeſcend that wee ioyn with Lutherans; and ſo D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall's Wiſh that wee joyn with the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Nor is it leſs ridiculous to call his Sects <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> Obſerve Reader who be thoſe they call <hi>Reformers;</hi> who be they, that are called Reformed Brethren, and what is that they call
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97770:35"/> 
                  <hi>Reformation;</hi> and you will confeſs no Names were euer more abuſed. As for the firſt and Chief Reformers, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that learned Treatiſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Gouerument, in his firſt book, and N. N. in his Dolefull fall of Andrew Sall giues you an exact deſcription of them; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall very wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declins their vindication from the wicked life N. N. ſaies they lead; for he ſaies the Reformation may be very good in itſelf, tho Luther and ſom other Reformers were naught; as in the Apoſtolical Colledge, ſaies he there was a Judas; it's very true D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, but if all the Apoſtolical Colledge was but a pack of <hi>Iudaſes,</hi> and not one honeſt man among them; could any man in his wits be perſuaded to belieue their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin was from God? this is your caſe D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, wee defy you to name as much as one among your firſt Reformers, who was as much as an honeſt man; do you name Luther? he was an Apoſtat Fryar, learned his Doctrin againſt Maſs, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to ſaints &amp;c. from the Deuil with whom he was frequently converſant as himſelf confeſſes to. 7.

Do you name Calvin? he was a ſodomit burnt in the ſhoulder for that crime at Noyon, lived a continual Scandal to the world at Geneue, and dyed a horror to nature as his own boſom friend Bolſeck relates in his life: do you name Beza? a man proſtituted to luſt and ſenſuality as the ſame Bolſeck who knew him relates: Zuinglius, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius Caroloſtadius, Goodman, Jacobus Andreas were of the ſame ſtamp. Neither were your firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of England of a better alloy; Cranmer a meer contemporiſer who married and vnmarried Henry the VIII. as often as he pleaſed; in his time he writ a Treatiſe in favor of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, for to pleaſe his Prince; and in king Edward the VI. time Zuinglia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm being the ſwaying Religion, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his note, and writ an other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt Tranſubſtantiation; Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glianiſm he profeſſed vntill he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd to death for hereſy and Treaſon by Queen Mary; then in hopes to ſaue his life he declared for the Catholic Religion, but ſeeing the ſentence was not repealed, he renounced again this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97770:36"/> and dyed a Zuinglian. Ochinus of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin became a Reformer, and ſo good an one, that he ran further and became a Jew. Martin Bucer, of a Dominican Fryar became a Lutheran, of a Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran became a Zuinglian; he became again a Lutheran, and returned again to be a Zuinglian: Hooper and Rogers both runagat Monks; Couerdale an Auguſtin Fryar; Bale a Carmelit; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martir a Chanon Regular, all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and theſe were your Reformers, judge you what the Reformation could be; and tell vs D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> can you name any one of this company that was famous for his Virtue, Miracles, or holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; nay any that was an honeſt man.</p>
               <p>And you will be no leſs ſurpriſed Reader when you conſider what kind of men are called Reformed Brethren; Monks fryars and Prieſts, as wee haue lately ſeen run from the Catholic Church to Proteſtancy; and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Popery is full of Errors forſooth; Tranſubſtantiation, Images, Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp;c. and out of a tender conſcience and loue of Truth they forſake theſe errors, and ſnperſtitious practices of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97770:37"/> Rome. Very well; let vs ſuppoſe thoſe Articles of Popery are Errors, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny practices of the Church of Rome are Superſtitions and againſt Gods Word; let vs commend and praiſe you for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing thoſe Errors: but why do you renounce and lay by, other practices, Doctrins, ad Devoirs to which you we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re obliged by Vow in the Catholic Church, and which in the judgment of all the Church of England are Holy, commendable and conformable to the Word of God? Be it ſo, let Purgatory be againſt Gods Word; renounce it; but its not againſt Gods Word to faſt from fleſh in lent and other dayes, your Common Prayer Book commands it; Why then do not you, Fryar, who obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged yourſelf vnder ſin to faſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the year from fleſh, why do you lay a ſyde this practice? you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced but the errors of Popery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God; this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: let Tranſubſtantiation be an error; renounce it; but its no error, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Gods Word to ſay your Office, your Matins and Laudes; to diſciplin your ſelf ſomtimes in the week; to liue in pouerty without any rents or reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97770:37"/> to liue in Chaſtity; theſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices are no Errors nor Superſtitions; why do you forſake them? let Prayers to Saints and before Images be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; ſorſake them, if you will be mad; but its no error nor profane or Superſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious practice, but the Counſel of Chriſt and the Practice of his Saints to forſake richs, lands, eſtates, Honors and dignities for Chriſt his ſake and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in povertie and humility for his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue; this you vowed to do when you were a Roman Catholic; why do not you keep that part of Popery; If the king and Parliament did enact (and it would be Much to the credit of the Proteſtant Church, it were enacted) that there ſhould be a houſe in ſom Country town wherin all Monks and Fryars who becom Proteſtants ſhould liue togither in Community vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Obedience to ſom Superiour as they did in the Catholic Church, (this is not againſt Scripture,) that none ſhould be permitted to eate fleſh in lent nor faſting daies, but faſt as they did in their reſpective Orders (nor is this againſt Scripture) that none ſhould be permitted to haue any Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97770:38"/> Benefice nor any Rents, but live vpon the charity of the People as they did when they were Catholics (nor is this againſt Scripture) that none ſhould be permitted to marry, nor to weare but meane attyre (nor is this againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that all of them ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſay their Divin Office, or a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſpalms equivalent to it euery day, and Diſciplin themſelues ſomti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the weeke as they were acuſtomed or obliged to do in their Orders; in ſuch acaſe indeed wee might think that ſuch as reuolted from the Catholics and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Proteſtants were moued by devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a tenderneſs of Conſcience, and they might with ſom appearance of truth be called Reformed Brethren; But that a company of Fryars ſhould run from the retirement of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to the court and houſes of great ones, from pouertie and beggery to look for Benefices and rents; from faſting, and other auſterities to which they are obliged, to eate and drink and cheriſh their fleſh; caſting aſyde their Breviaries and Meditations, and marrying; what half witted man in the world will call ſuch men Reformed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97770:38"/> men but rather men proſtituted to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs and bankrupts in Honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>By this diſcours you may perceiue how little or rather nothing the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church has for to deſerue that plauſible name of <hi>Reformation;</hi> no name in the world more vnbecoming it: for a Reformation is a change of a large life into a ſtrict one; its a Profeſſion of a more auſtere life, and of more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration than formerly was: how then can <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> be called a Reformation of the Catholic Religion; put the caſe in Luther, Calvin, and the reſt of Prieſts and Fryars who change the Catholic for the Proteſtant Religion: its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by what I ſaid and by what the world ſees, they leaue a narrow, ſtrict, and auſtere manner of life, for a more eaſy large and pleaſant one; for in the Catholic they were obliged vnder ſin to ſay their Breviary euery day; to faſt the greateſt part of the yeare, to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral auſterities of ryſing at midnight to the Quyre, of Diſciplin and haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths; never to marry, neuer to haue any rents but liue in poverty, to liue vnder Obedience of their Superiors
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97770:39"/> with a total ſubmiſſion of their Wills to his; they were obliged to confeſs their ſins to a Prieſt, to ſubmit their judgments in matters of Religion to the Paſtor of the Church, to obey the Precepts of the Church. This manner of life is it which they vere obliged to lead in the Catholic Religion: And they forſook this for Proteſtancy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they are not bound to any Breviary, nor other Prayers vnder ſin; where they can without a remors of conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce make good cheer all the yeare; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they can marry and get a good Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an Eccleſiaſtical Benefice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids; where they are not obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, nor obey any Commandments of the Church (none obliges them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;) where they may belieue what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they judge is the Doctrin and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Scripture, let their Paſtors and Church belieue what they liſt: who can deny but this exchange of life is from an auſtere to a large, from a rigid to a more eaſy, from a ſtrict to a more pleaſant life: and is this it wee call Reformation? In the Catholic Church wee can haue but one faith; wee are obliged to profeſs one and the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97770:39"/> Doctrin, practice Vniformly the ſame Rites and Ceremonies; in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation you haue many different faiths; you may with a ſafe conſcience profeſs what Doctrin you pleaſe, either the Lutheran, Preſbiterian, Calvinian &amp;c. for what euer of them you belieue you will be ſtill of the Reformation. And can this be called a Reformation? which deſtroies vnity, rents the Flock into ſo many Sects, and giues vs ſuch liberty to belieue as wee fancy?</p>
               <p>Perhaps our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> may anſwer that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy is a <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of Popery, becauſe this ſwarms with many Errors; but what is <hi>Doctrin</hi> for, but for to reform our lyues? and how can that be a <hi>Reformation</hi> of Doctrin, which leads to ſuch a corruption of Manners?</p>

               </head>
               <p>OUR Doctor in his two firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt J.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97770:40"/> are accuſed by him and his fellows to be vncharitable for denying ſaluation out of their Church, do grant to Pagans and Turks; it being the Doctrin of moſt learned Divins, for not belieuing the Bible to be Gods Word, for not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacraments, nay nor the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Paſſion of Chriſt, a man will not be damn'd, if he has invincible ignorance of theſe Miſteries, or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his Errors: and this is that great charity of Proteſtants beyond Catholics, when they ſay that Roman Catholics may be ſaued in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that's to ſay, that they are in as great a capacity for ſaluation as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Turks.</p>
               <p>He ſcrues vp the peggs of his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation againſt me for making him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that wicked Poſition, <hi>That in the Roman Catholic Church a man cannot be ſaued,</hi> and to proue him the Author of it, there needs no more, than to hear him ſpeake: Page 116. of his Sermon he ſaies, <hi>No learned Proteſtant does allow the Popiſh Religion generally and abſoluty ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be a ſecure way of ſaluation; for all do agree that many of their Tenets and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are inconſiſtent with ſaluation; tho</hi>

But he ads that Ignorance may ſaue ſom of <hi>the ſimple ſors;</hi> by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor he does not ſay abſolutly that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may ſaue <hi>euen ſom of the ſimple</hi> ſort; <hi>Haply</hi> it may, ſaies he, that's to ſay, <hi>perhaps</hi> it may; nothing Sure as to that: Tenets inconſiſtent with ſaluation abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly block vs the entrance into heauen, if ignorance does not deſobſtruct it; and its not certain that ignorance can do it, <hi>Haply</hi> it may, ſaies our Doctor ſo that if Catholics do not renounce their Errors by repentance, it's a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one, if any of them euer goes to Heauen.</p>

               <p>Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> pag. 9. of his Reply giues vs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97770:43"/> the Definition of <hi>Invincible Ignorance; Its ſuch as one cannot remedy by means obvious to him acording his ſtate and condition.</hi> He therefore who has the means obuious to him acording his ſtate and condition of life for to remedy his <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and remains ſtill ignorant; his Ignorance cannot be called <hi>Invincible,</hi> but <hi>Supin</hi> and <hi>groſs,</hi> becauſe he does not make vſe of thoſe <hi>Means obuious vnto him;</hi> But Aquinas, Bernard and all our learned Saincts and Doctors had the ſufficient and neceſſarie <hi>Mcans</hi> obuious to them for to remedy their Ignorance; for they had the Scripture which our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaies pag. 29. of his ſermon, and alſo often in his book, <hi>abounds with all heauenly light</hi> and cleerly ſets down the Proteſtant Tenets to all thoſe who are not <hi>willfully blind.</hi> If therefore they were Ignorant, their ignorance was not invincible; they did not vſe the means they had, <hi>they did not ſearch with due care and enquiry,</hi> and Ignorance will not excuſe, ſaies our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, <hi>thoſe who Know, or with due care and enquiry may Know the truth.</hi> Is it not by Scripture alone that Luther and Calvin eſpied out the Errors of Rome? is it not by Scripture, Councils and fathers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97770:43"/> our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaies, himſelf was convinced of the truth of Proteſtancy? S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas, Bernard and the reſt of our D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> and Saints had the Scripture Councils and fathers and ſtudied them more than D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall; they had therefore the Means obuious to their ſtate and condition for to remedy their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; it was not therefore invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>I doubt if any but our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> would vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch à Paradox, and I am ſure none would prove it more ridiculouſly; Aquinas ſaies, he pag. 8. and the reſt were invincibly ignorant, <hi>becauſe the errors of the Church of Rome were not ſo many in his time as now; they increaſed day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they were not ſo knowen and cleered in the crucible of public oppoſition; none dared to check them, and ſo they kept credit; they be gan to be in vſe in his time or ſom what before and were not oppoſed.</hi> Was there euer ſuch a wild ramble of talk, and ſuch a heap of vntruths coucht in ſo few lynes? wee muſt not attempt to retort him by the teſtimony of any Catholic Doctor, for hee'l ſay they are all Ignorant as Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas; but I hope he will giue credit to his own illuminated Brethren Humfry

                  <hi>SEVERAL OTHER ATTACKS OF our Doctor againſt the Saints: the Proteſtant Kalender of Saints examined.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Found Aquinas and others, ſtyled by the name of <hi>Saints</hi> in our D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and reioyced to ſee him retain that reſpect for their glorious memory; but it ſoon repented him of his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he learned in <hi>Oxford</hi> that was not the true <hi>Reformed</hi> language; the purer Brethren Anabaptiſts, Presbiterians and Quakers judge it to be Popiſh; and the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. to giue them ſatisfaction for the ſcandal they might haue taken at his ſtyle; corrects it in his new Book: he was not in earneſt, he ſaies, when he called them <hi>Saints;</hi> it's but an Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie title, as the Compiler of London
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97770:46"/> 
                  <hi>Gazets</hi> calls the Popes, <hi>his Holyneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Concluſion of the <hi>Vnerring Vnerrable Church</hi> I argued, that any wiſe man tender of his ſaluation ought to chuſe that Church where many Saints eminent for their Virtue and glorious for their Miracles liued and dyed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that, where neuer any man was knowen eminent for either; as you would chuſe to ſtudy in a ſchool, where many men eminent for learning were educated, rather than in a ſchool where no learned man was ever knowen: Hence I concluded the Catholic Church ought to be chuſen before the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; wheras in that wee reckon ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminently holy and miraculous Saints and D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>, <hi>Aquinas, Bernard, Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, Gregory Auſtin</hi> &amp;c. and in this none was euer heard of: Our Doctor anſwers, our Saints are only <hi>Titular</hi> ones, no <hi>Real</hi> Saints; <hi>they purchas'd their Titles</hi> (ſaies he pag. 228.) <hi>by public Authority as Dukes and Earles do theirs.</hi> Is not this a reſpectfull Child of Gods Church? who pulls down the Pillars of Chriſtianity, and ſtrips them of the honor exhibited to them by the Orthodox world.</p>
               <p>I pray Reader if you chance to ſee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97770:46"/> him before he reads this book, aſk him his opinion of thoſe Saints recorded in his Proteſtant Kalender prefixed to the Common Prayer book: are they alſo but <hi>Titular</hi> only and no <hi>Real</hi> Saints? was it by their merits they purchas'd their Titles, or by public Authority as Dukes and Earles did theirs? if this ſecond; aſk him what public authority was that? if a Popiſh authority; how com the Church of England to profane their kalender with the foorberie of Rome, and propoſe to the reſpect at leaſt, if not adoration of the flock a company of fellows who are no Real Saints, and place them in the ſame Catalogue with Chriſt, his Mother and the Apoſtles; and the kalender being ordained only for to eterniſe the memorie of men Eminent in Santitie and virtue, and juſtly reputed Saints by the Church, how com they to ſtuff it with men who are not real but Titular only Saints: if it was a Proteſtant public Autority? &amp; <hi>Vos in eadem damnatione eſt is.</hi> Are yee alſo guilty of that foul practice, as through a vain oſtentation of your Churchs holyneſs to put in your kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a company of falſly reputed Saints,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97770:47"/> who are but <hi>Titular</hi> ones, and <hi>Honorarily</hi> called ſo, as the London Gazet calls the Pope, <hi>his Holyneſs?</hi> Are the Saints recorded in the Proteſtant Kalender truly and Really Saints, or not? if they be not, what a ridiculous thing was't to put them there, more than <hi>Cromwell,</hi> or <hi>Arrius,</hi> or <hi>Luther;</hi> if they were, I'l proue they were Saints of our Church, and conſequently proue your Poſition, <hi>that our Saints are only Titular and no Real Saints,</hi> to be impious.</p>
               <p>You haue in the Month of March in your Kalender, S. Gregorie Pope who liued the year 600. and brought into England, as I related out of your own Hiſtorians, Maſs, Purgatorie, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation &amp;c. if he was not à Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, ther's none in Rome; and he is a Saint of your Kalender, <hi>and yee haue no Titular only, but real Saints,</hi> as you ſay pag. 228. you haue in the ſame month S. Benedict Monk, who liued the year 540; famous for his Monachiſm, auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of life, and Religious order: can the Proteſtants challenge him to be theirs, who hate Monachiſm as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil hates Holy Water. You haue in the ſame month in your Kalender (but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97770:47"/> in ours, its the fifth of Ianuary) S. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward king of the Saxons who liued the year 1066. Ancient Cronicles beare witneſs of his devotion to S. Peter and S. John, his vow of Chaſtity, his vow of pilgrimage to Rome and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of this vow granted by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe; and the Monaſtery of Winſmeſter he built for the Benedictian Friars: was this a Ptoteſtant Saint think you? yet he muſt be a real Saint, becauſe he is in your Kalender.</p>
               <p>You have in the month of April S. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Biſhop of Chicheſter, who lived the year 1255. he was conſecrated Biſhop by the Pope himſelf againſt all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauors of king Richard, who ſent his Embaſſador to Rome to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hinder his conſecration; and the king was obliged by the Pope to put him in poſſeſſion of his Biſhoprick: all this ſmells ſtrongly of Popery: I pray tell vs, why was he put in your Kalender? was it becauſe he was a Biſhop? and why were not Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Ridley and Latimer, put there; becauſe he was of an other mold; an Eminent, and not only a Titular Saint.</p>
               <p>You haue in your Kalender in the month of May S. Dunſtan ArchBishop
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97770:48"/> of Canterbury who lived the yeare 988. when there was no Proteſtant, nor any thing like it, he went to Rome to get his Pall from the Pope, which ſufficiently evidences he was no Proteſtant; and a Real Saint he muſt be, or why ſhould he be put in your Kalender. You haue in the ſame month S. Anſtin Monk, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of England, ſent by S Gregory to preach the Doctrin which now you perſecut</p>
               <p>You haue in the month of June S. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface B. and M. who liued the year 754. he was no Martir of Fox's Kalender; nor did he ſhed his blood for Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm or Proteſtancy.</p>
               <p>You haue in the month of September S. Gyles an Abbot of a Monaſtery and a Prieſt: it was his good luck he dyed the year 550. for had he liued till the Reformation he had forfeited many hundred Marks, and his Monaſterie too, for the many Maſſes he ſaid; he liued much in the exerciſe of corporal auſterities, feeding commonly on roots and herbs; lodged many years in a Caue, without any bed but the bare ground; this Saint is nothing like a Child of the Reformation.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:97770:48"/>
               <p>You haue in the month of November S. Leonard Confeſſor who liued the yeare 559. built a Chappel to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the B. Virgin and conſecrated an Altar in it to S. Remigius; theſe practices ſufficiently evidence he was no Proteſtant; and his being recorded in your Kalender, marks he was a Real Saint, for in your Kalender there is no other. You haue in the ſame month S. Brice Biſhop; Nephew to S. Martin and a Catholic he muſt haue bin; wheras, being baniſht from his Biſhopric he had his recours to the Pope for to be reinſtalld.</p>
               <p>You haue alſo in the ſame month S. Hugh Arch Biſhop of Canterbury a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſian Fryar who liued the year 1200. a notorious Papiſt; not only becauſe he was a Carthuſian; but becauſe he was ſo auſtere in his manner of liuing and mortificacions, that being made a Biſhop he would neuer eat fleſh, and euen at his dying houre had no other bed, but the bare ground wheron he cauſed himſelf to be laid, wrapt in a haire cloth and aſhes.</p>
               <p>I know the Nativity of <hi>our gratious Soueraign</hi> is mentioned in your Kalender
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97770:49"/> for to mind vs to pray for his long and happy life; alſo <hi>Gounpounder Treaſon</hi> day, for to giue God thanks, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the king and Parliament againſt that horrid plot, but why thoſe Saints ſhould be recorded in your Kalender, but for hauing bin men of Eminent and knowen Holyneſs, and for our example and encouragement to the imitation of their Virtues, you neuer can tell; it would be therefore an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety in you to deny they were true and real Saints, and it would be want of ſenſe and judgment in you to deny they were of the Roman Catholic Church, for how can the Proteſtants challenge, Carthuſians, Monks, Abbots, Bishops conſecrated by the Pope, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to him in their greeuances, to be of theirs.</p>
               <p>Now if you will act the part of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of your Church, (and the credit of it, depends of your good ſucceſs heerin) you muſt ſhew vs, ſom Saints, or one Saint of knowen publickly repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Holyneſs of life and converſation, who cofeſſedly was a Proteſtant, and whom wee cannot with any appearance of reaſon deny to be yours; as you
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97770:49"/> cannot deny thoſe Monks, Abbots, Carthuſians &amp;c. named in your kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ours: you ſay Fryars Monks and Abbots are ſuperſtitious <hi>Bigots,</hi> and foorbs; for all that, there haue been ſom of that Profeſſion ſo honeſt men, as to haue deſerued a place in your ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender; which is a manifeſt proof, that the Tenor of life which they profeſſed is not ſuperſtitious, nor the Tenets of Religion they belieued, are not <hi>errors inconſiſtent with ſaluation:</hi> I pray ſhew vs any one Miniſter or Biſhop of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church, ſince the beginning of the Reformation; ſhew vs any of the <hi>Image breakers, ryflers of Monaſteries, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of Prieſts and Fryars, believers of Figurative Preſence, Scoffers of Indulgences</hi> and Purgatorie (this is Proteſtancy) that was ſo honeſt a man as to haue deſerued a place in your kalender: and if you can ſhew none; then the prudent Reader will judge my diſcours to be good that any wiſe man tender of his ſaluation ought to liue and dye in the Catholic Church, where many Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and illuſtrious Saints haue bin; rather than in the Proteſtant, where neuer any was knowen.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:97770:50"/>
               <p>But our reckoning is not at an end D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>; you remember that old charge againſt your Reformation, neuer yet anſwered; that your Separation from the Catholic Church was a Spiritual Rebellion, a formal ſchiſm: your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is that the Schiſm is <hi>Cauſally</hi> ours; that by our Idolatry, and many other errors, wee forced you to ſeparat from vs; That wee ſeparated from the Doctrin of Chriſt, and therefore you ſeparated from vs. But all this appears to be an idle talk without any ſenſe; for, Eminent Saints, glorious for their virtues, Holyneſs and Miracles, are not to be found, but in the Profeſſion of the true faith of Chriſt; if therefore in our Church ſuch Saints of knowen Sanctity be found; its a manifeſt and vndeniable proof, that the true faith of Chriſt is in our Church: Now I aſk you and your Camerades; when did our Church ſeparat from the Doctrin of Chriſt? ſom of you ſay, in the firſt 300. years; others of you ſay, that about the firſt 600. This appears to be manifeſtly fals; for in the enſuing ages all along vntill the year 1255. (then Richard Biſhop of Chicheſter liued)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97770:50"/> there were Eminent Saints of knowen and renowned Holyneſs and Miracles in our Church; (for all thoſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Saints recorded in your kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were ours as I haue proued) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true faith and Doctrin of Chriſt continued ſtill in our Church, and your Schiſm is not <hi>cauſally</hi> ours, but without any cauſe yours.</p>
               <p>And truly whateuer you may ſay of your Separation; I cannot imagin how your Church or you will excuſe your Ouerſight in prefixing that kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your Common prayer book: I do not think there could be a more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reproach to your Church: Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers were never ſo tempted to ſweare, that this kalender ſmells more of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſn Conſpiracy than Gunpounder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon day; they will neuer belieue but that ſom Papiſt had a hand in making it; for can he be a Child of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who pur <hi>Gregory</hi> Pope, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk in <hi>Our Reformed Kalender,</hi> for being the firſt who brought Popery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England; and left out Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Peter Martyr and others who firſt preached the Reformation? can he be a Reformed Child, who put <hi>Benedict,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:97770:51"/> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> Monks and Hugh a Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Fryar in our Reformed kalender, and in the mean time wee hang men in Tyburn for following their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Tenor of life: Either the Reformation had any one Eminent Saint ſince its firſt ryſe, or not? if it had; why haue not you put him in your kalender? if it had not? had it not been more to the credit of your Church, to haue made no kalender; than by making one, giue fo public a teſtimony to the world, how poor your Church is of Saints, that to furniſh your kalender you muſt borrow them out of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary: beſids D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, euen for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of particular Citties, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, God makes vſe of Holy men, of an exemplar life; and to ſay that God ſhould haue intruſted the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the whole Church, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of turbulent Spirits, and not as much as one man in the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be of Eminent Holyneſs, nor exemplar life: its againſt the grain of Man's reaſon to belieue it.</p>
               <p>Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> not content to attack the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of our Saints; coms with a freſh charge againſt their manner of life: for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97770:51"/> I argued in the Concluſion of the <hi>Vner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Vnerrable Church,</hi> that Chriſt's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, of forſaking lands, eſtates, and means, and embracing povertie; was commended, preached, and practis'd in our Chutch, witneſs the many Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders, where ſeueral Perſons haue forſaken their plentifull eſtates; and no ſuch Doctrin was euer preached or practis'd in the Proteſtant Church; alſo Chriſt's Counſel (recommended to vs by S. Pauls Doctrin and example) of corporal Auſterities, Diſciplins haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths, ſleeping on the bare ground, ryſing at midnight to ſing Pſalms in God's prayſe, &amp;c. was and is practis'd frequently by all ſexes and ages in our Church; and what Miniſter or Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant was euer heard of that ryſes at midnight to ſing Gods prayſes; that diſciplins himſelf, &amp;c. Hence I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that to be the Church of Chriſt, which followed his Counſels, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Catholic to be Chriſt's Church. Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> anſwers like a good Chriſtian, that our corporal Auſterities and mortifications are like to them of Pagans and Heathens, tending to the deſtruction of Body and Soule; that the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97770:52"/> Proteſtants vſe corporal auſterities, but <hi>diſcreetly:</hi> that our Auſterities are deſperat and indiſcreet. And what Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian will hear with patience, Chriſtian Auſterities vndertaken for the loue of God, and practiſed by the greateſt Saints of the Church; to be lykned by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, to the Auſterities of Pagans, to be condemn'd as deſtructiue to Body and Soule? The Auſterity of the great Baptiſt, ſo much commended in the Ghoſpell, exceeds far that of our Monks and Fryars; and if theirs be deſtructiue to Body and Soule, the great Baptiſt is vndon: the Auſterity and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of David ſurpaſſed far, that of our Monks, Fryars and Nuns; and if theſe haue deſtroyed their bodies and Soules by their Mortifications; if their Auſterities be indiſcreet and deſperat; if they be like the auſterities of Pagans: in what a condition will Dauid be?</p>
               <p>Henceforth I hope, he will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that S. Benedict was a Proteſtant (tho in his kalender) but a Catholic or a Pagan, for ryſing at midnight to the Quire to ſing Gods Praiſes as David did; for his many indiſcreet and deſperat auſterities like them of Pagans; to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97770:52"/> which he obliged his Monks by the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of his Order. S. Gyles alſo mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Proteſtant kalender muſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bin a Papiſt or a Pagan; ſo indiſcreet and deſperat he was in his auſterities deſtructive to body and ſoule, sleeping on the bare ground for many years, feeding on herbs and roots; no Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant was ever ſo indiſcreet. To conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, none who forſook ſilks and ſattins for a poore habit; good cheer for a poore portion; pomp and vanity for a retyred and auſtere life as the great Baptiſt did, and innumerable of our Church; none I ſay of them were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, they are not ſo indiſcreet and deſperat: D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall indeed was once ſo indiſcreet, as to haue vndertaken this cours of life; but now in his old age, he is become wiſe, and has changed his habit for good attire; his ſcant and poore fare, for good cheer; his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious retirement for a court; his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie for Rents; his religious humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a <hi>Deanry</hi> (which they ſay he has) his Obedience to Superiors, for a full poſſeſſion of his own Will; his auſterities and mortifications, for more pleaſure and ſatisfaction than cuer
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97770:53"/> he had; and this is the Diſcretion of Proteſtants, and the way to Saluation.</p>

                  <hi>OVR DOCTOR'S CONFVSED DISCOVRS of our Rule of faith: a Parallell of Proteſtants and Ancient Heretics.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HE perceiued the main Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie wherof the reſolution of all others depend, to be that of our Rule of faith, and the neceſſity of a liuing Judge for to determin our doubts in Religion: therefore I ſo carefully han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled this point in my former Treatiſe and with ſtrength of reaſon and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proued, that Scripture alone, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout an infallible liuing Interpreter was not our Rule of faith. But my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, reſolued to continue, rather than to end wrangling, hand les this queſtion ſo ſuperficially and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus-edly that he does but hint at it heer and there in ſeueral Chapters; nor can wee fixedly perceiue what Rule of faith he eſtabliſhs for himſelf. For Now, he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97770:53"/> ſaies Scripture alone is his Rule; then he layes that aſide, and ſets vp the Apoſtles, and four firſt General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Creeds; again he waues that, and brings in a third Rule; that's to ſay for fundamental points neceſſary to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation, <hi>the Apoſtles Creed</hi> alone; and for points not fundamental or inferior Truths the <hi>Word of God,</hi> whether <hi>Written</hi> that's the Bible; or <hi>vnwritten</hi> that's Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: thus he hops from branch to branch much indeed to his credit; for when others find it a ſufficient taſk to hit on one Rule of faith; his wit is ſo fertil as to find three, but his luck is naught that none is good.</p>
               <p>His firſt Rule is <hi>Scripture alone;</hi> this he aſſerts pag. 29. of his Sermon and page 24. againſt I. S. in his new book; and what is to be admired in ſo fertil a Wit, that he could not hit on any proof for ſo conſiderable a point, whereof the reſolution of ſo many Controverſies depends, but that only Text of S. Paul 2. Tim. 3. <hi>Holy Scripture is able to make vs wiſe vnto ſaluation, that the man of God &amp;c.</hi> out of which he concludes pag. 29. of his Sermon, <hi>that Scripture alone is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; abounding with all heavenly light for</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:97770:54"/> 
                  <hi>inſtruction to thoſe who are not willfully blind;</hi> and this alone, and nothing els of Scripture or reaſon he anſwers to my two long Chapters againſt the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Scripture for our Rule of faith: and tho I proved in my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, by many inſtances, that this Text of S. Paul does not prove the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Scripture; I haue no other anſwer from him, but that I am a <hi>Twice Impious Sophiſter; that I mend the text inſteed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting it;</hi> that <hi>I giue the Apoſtle the lie:</hi> truly his miſtake is in ſom meaſure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable; for the Apoſtle was once cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saul;</hi> our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> haply, miſtook <hi>Saul</hi> for <hi>Sall;</hi> and thought I corrected the text of Saul the Apoſtle, when I checkt the inference from it, of <hi>Sall</hi> the Apoſtat.</p>
               <p>I anſwered the Apoſtle did not ſay Scripture <hi>alone</hi> was able for to inſtruct vs; and beſides the many proofs I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for this in the <hi>Vnerring Vnerrable Church;</hi> I do now again prove it: for its manifeſt Sctipture cannot inſtruct vs to ſaluation, if it be not rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; its alſo manifeſt that the true vnderſtanding of Scripture is not had with aſſurance, without an infallible
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97770:54"/> Interpreter; for ſaies S. Peter 2. Epiſt. 1. 20. <hi>No Prophecy of Scripture,</hi> (that's to ſay aſſured interpretation) <hi>is of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat interpretation; for Prophecies came not in old times from the Will of men, but the holy men of God ſpoke as they were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Therefore its manifeſt that Scripture alone, interpreted by privat Perſons, and without an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpreter is not able to inſtruct vs to ſaluation. He replies its ridiculous to ſay, <hi>Scripture is able,</hi> if Scripture <hi>alone</hi> be not able; as it would be <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſaies he, to ſay you are able to carrie two hundred weight; and when you com to the tryal you muſt haue a horſe to help you:</hi> And by this Dialect, wee muſt affirm the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> was not able to anſwer J. S. his book, becauſe when he came to the trial, he muſt go to <hi>Oxford</hi> for Englih; nor muſt wee ſay he is able to reade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without ſpectacles he cannot; and it will be ridiculous to ſay you can make a voyage to England, if you cannot go alone without ſhip and ſeamen. Pray Sr. was the Apoſtle ridiculous when he ſaid <hi>Men are ſaued by Hope</hi> Rom. 8. 24. for its evident his meaning was not that Hope <hi>alone</hi> can ſaue vs: was he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97770:55"/> ridiculous when he ſaid <hi>wee are juſtified by faith;</hi> for its apparent that faith alone does not juſtify vs: and why ſhould it be ridiculouſly ſaid by him that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is ſufficient for to inſtruct vs, tho Scripture alone be not ſufficient? O but, ſay you, in other places the Apoſtle ſaies wee muſt haue charity and other Virtues; and thence it appears his meaning was not that <hi>Hope</hi> alone, and <hi>faith</hi> alone can ſaue vs; and ſo do I ſay, the Apoſtle in other places bids vs hold Traditions, and the Scripture in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places bids vs conſult in our doubts, and hear the Church; conſequently S. Paul when he ſaid Scripture was able to inſtruct vs, his meanning was not that Scripture alone was able.</p>
               <p>Wiſe men haue more than one ſtring to their bow; our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> foreſeeing this Rule of faith was not ſufficient; ſets vp an other, which is the Apoſtles Creed alone: pag. 10 againſt N.

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:97770:55"/> 
                  <hi>men, and neceſſary to be belieued explicitly.</hi> After hauing thus magnified the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency ef the Apoſtles Creed alone; in the ſame place againſt N. N. he alters his note, and will not have it alone to be a ſufficient Rule of our faith, but joyntly with the Creeds of the four firſt General Councils; and as he wavers in his Doctrin, ſo his proof is abſurd, which coms but to this; <hi>That it's ſtrange any man not blinded with partiality ſhould imagin the Apoſtles intruſted to preach ſauing Doctrin to all the World ſhould not haue giuen ſufficient notice of it in the ſyſtem of Articles they left vnto vs: that thoſe Venerable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the purer ages of Chriſtianity congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the four firſt General Councils ſhould giue vs but a Diminut account of Catholic beliefe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> if the Apoſtles Creed alone contains all neceſſary Articles to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the firſt part of your diſcours pretends, what need had you to ad the Creeds of the four Councils as a part of your Rule of faith? and if the Creeds of the Councils contain any thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation, which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Apoſtles Creed; then that of the Apoſtles alone is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97770:56"/> Rule: I pray D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is this a good diſcours, Chriſt intruſted to teach vs to ſaluation preached a Sermon to his diſciples Math 18. therefore all inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Articles neccſſary for our ſaluation is expreſſed in that Sermon; ſurely you will ſay this is a very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Silly diſcours; giue me leaue to ſay ſo much of yours, which is this; The Apoſtles and Councils intruſted to teach vs to ſaluation, delivered vs theſe Creeds; therefore all Articles and inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction neceſſary to ſaluation are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when you ſay that thoſe Creeds of the Apoſtles and Councils contain all neceſſary points to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be explicitly believed, and are a ſufficient Rule of faith; Do you mean, that to be ſaued it is neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve explicitly all the contents of thoſe Creeds? what ſort of men do you ſpeake of? if of Perſons who neuer had any inſtruction, you require too much; for no Divin will ſtick to grant that men, euen after the promulgation of the Ghoſpell may be ſaued, believing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly the Miſteries of the Trinity, Incarnation, and Paſſion of Chriſt for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97770:56"/> our Redemption, tho they ſhould ignore explicitly other Articles expreſſed in the Creeds: if you ſpeake of Perſons ſufficiently inſtructed in Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; wee muſt know, how far they are inſtructed; if only of the contents of thoſe Creeds; then indeed it is ſufficient to their ſaluation to belieue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thoſe Creeds, and no more is requiſit to be belieued explicitly; but if they be inſtructed alſo of other Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, which you call inferior Truths, as Infants Baptiſm, Epiſcopacy, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind, the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and two Sacraments; then indeed tho theſe Verities be not contained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly in them Creeds, its needfull to ſaluation to belieue them explicitly; and I hope I need no more proof to convince you of this truth, than your own conceſſions; for pag. 60. you ſay, <hi>that theſe inferior Verities are of equal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective certainty with fundamental Verities and are to be belieued explicitly when they are ſufficiently propoſed to vs to be revealed Truths:</hi> you cannot deny but that thoſe inferior Verities are ſufficienrly propos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to you and to your Church; for you ſay they are cleerly contained in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97770:57"/> Scripture; you engage to prove them by Gods Written Word; in ſo much that you ſay its an error inconſiſtent with ſaluation to deny them; therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you may ſay of Pagans or ill inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructed Chriſtians, its evident in your Principles that you and your Church are obliged to belieue explicitly thoſe inferior Truths, becauſe they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed vnto you to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed Truths; but not one of thoſe Truths is explicitly contained in the Creeds; therefore all points of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie explicit belief to your, and your Church's ſaluation are not explicitly contained in the Creeds.</p>
               <p>Miſtake me not D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, the queſtion is not what may be a ſufficient Rule of faith to Perſons who are not well inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructed; who neuer heard, but little of Religion: I haue, and do again grant that the Creeds contain all points of neceſſary explicit belief to the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Perſons, who haue bin inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructed of no more, but what is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, nay I ſay more, that in regard of ſom Perſons who neuer heard of thoſe Creeds, and were inſtructed only of the Miſtery of the Trinity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97770:57"/> and Paſſion of Chriſt; thoſe Creeds contain more than is neceſſary to be explicitly believed by them: But the queſtion is, what is a ſufficient Rule containing all points of neceſſary expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Belief to your Church and ours, which abound with light and inſtruction to faith? whether the Creeds alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all points which your Church is obliged vnder pain of damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue explicitly? and its evident they do not; for you ſay you are obliged to believe explicitly thoſe Inferior Truths, becauſe they are ſufficiently propoſed to you to be <hi>Reuealed;</hi> its an error in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſaluation to deny them, you ſay; and yet they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Creeds: therefore the Creeds are not a ſufficient Rule of faith to you and your Church.</p>
               <p>I haue in my former Treatiſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc't the inſufficiency of Scripture alone without an infallible Interpreter for to regulat our faith; and becauſe our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> does boaſt much of the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his Church in Doctrin with the firſt and pureſt ages, I will briefly ſhew, their Conformity with the firſt and impureſt Heretics; for who regulat
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97770:58"/> their faith by one and the ſame Rule; tho they may differ in ſom material points of Doctrin, they haue one and the ſame faith. The Ancient Heretics would haue no Rule of faith but Scripture; and that, not as interpreted by the Church, but as each one vnderſtood it; what they found, acording their beſt vnderſtanding in Scripture; that they belieued; what they did not find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed there, they rejected; tho the Councils or Church did teach it. <hi>Theſe things are not found in Scripture</hi> (ſaid the Arrians diſputing againſt the Conſubſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantiality of the ſon of God with the father) <hi>and what is not read there wee reject.</hi> Athan. in Epiſt. de Syn. Arm. &amp; Seleu. <hi>If you bring</hi> Scripture (ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximinus to S. Auguſtin) <hi>wee will liſten vnto you; but theſe Words which are not in Scripture wee do not value. In what Scripture are two Natures of Chriſt mentioned</hi> (ſaies Eutyches) <hi>wee follow nothing but Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and care not what expoſition of it the Church giues. Let vs belieue what wee read in Scripture</hi> (ſaie the Pelagians) <hi>and what wee do not read in it, let vs not believe it.</hi> This was the precincts of Ancient Heretics belief; Scripture alone, their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97770:58"/> Rule of faith; thus they trampled the authority of the Church, for to vent their fancies without curb.</p>
               <p>If you read the Doctrin and books of our Modern Sectaries, you will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Tranſmigration of ſoules; and that the old Heretics are com again vpon the ſtage to act of the new, in the perſons of Luther, Calvin, &amp;c. what they haue already don in former ages. <hi>Our Rule of faith,</hi> ſaies Luther l. de Ser. Arb. &amp; to. 2. Wittem: <hi>is but Scripture as each one interprets it; wee receiue nothing but Scripture. Wee are not to ſubmit our judgments to the Deciſions of Synods or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> (ſaies Calvin, l. 4. Inſtit. c. 9.) <hi>if after hauing examined Scripture, wee do not find their interpretation and Doctrin to be according the Word of God. Its needleſs</hi> (ſaies Barlow, in Defenſ. Religionis Proteſt pag. 199.) <hi>that either Pope or Council, Man or Angel ſhould teach vs; the Spirit Working in our hearts and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to each one aſſured Interpreters Our Rule of faith is Scripture, as each Perſon of ſound judgment in the Church vnderſtands it:</hi> ſaies the Church of England in the 39. Art. Did euer any egg reſemble more an other, than our Sectaries do
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97770:59"/> the Ancient Heretics in their Rule of faith? ſo far from agreeing with the firſt and pureſt ages, that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fathers expreſly denyed Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone to be our ſufficient Rule of faith; which I will prove with ſom few paſſages; it would be tedious to relate many.</p>
               <p>S. Denis Areop. de Eccleſ. Hier. c. 1. ſaies <hi>Som things haue been recorded in Holy Writ; other heigher and more ſublime Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, our holy Leaders and Maſters, haue from hand to hand, by preaching and Doctrin without any written Word delivered to Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</hi> So far he was from belieuing Scripture alone contained all neceſſary points to ſaluation; that he ſaies the moſt ſublime miſteries are not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them: and of this ſentiment is alſo S.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97770:59"/> expreſly teach, that the Apoſtles did purpoſely omit to write plainly of the moſt excellent and heigh Miſteries of our Religion, contented to teach them lightly, becauſe the Vulgar ſort was not capable of ſuch ſublime Doctrin, and therefore committed them to the Paſtors of the Church to be declared more particularly, as occaſion required and time permitted: Epiph. Haereſi 61. ſaies, <hi>All things cannot be taken from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Apoſtles haue declared ſom things by writing, and ſom by Tradition.</hi> Of the Nature, form, Matter, and effects of the Sacraments, (Points without doubt of neceſſary belief to ſaluation) wee know ſo little, that they are knowen to vs, only by Tradition, as S. Auguſtin obſerved lib. 1. de Fide &amp; Oper. c. 9. vpon the paſſage of the Eunuch bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Philip, <hi>The Evangeliſt ſignified all things were fullfilled in that action; which tho for brevity's ſake they are ſylenc'd in Scripture; wee know by Tradition they ought to haue bin don.</hi>

               <p>And will our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> perſwade vs, that Scripture alone is ſufficient for our inſtruction to ſaluation, againſt ſuch emphatical expreſſions of the Ancient

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97770:60"/> the celebrated notion of it deliuered by Lirinenſis, Quod vbique, quod ſemper, quod apud omnes eſt creditum, what was allwaies, in all places and by all men believed, that is to be taken for Vniverſal Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vltimat motiue therefore of his faith, and Rule of his Belief is Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tradition, as wee haue heard him deſcribe it; <hi>To this,</hi> (ſaies he pag. 29.) <hi>wee are reſolued to ſtand, or fall, as well for diſcerning the Canon of Scripture, as for Vnderſtanding the truc ſenſe of it. A Dieu</hi> henceforward S. Paul's text, and ſo many pages of good Engliſh vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly ſpent to defend the ſufficiency of Scripture alone for our Rule of faith: now our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> has pitcht vpon an other; he will belieue no Scripture, no ſenſe of Scripture; no revealed Truth, but what is warranted by this <hi>Apoſtolic Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis</hi> (as he vnderſtands it) Tradition; that is to ſay, but what is believed in all places, in all times and by all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: whatever was denied in any time, in any place, or by any Chriſtians, our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> will not belieue it, no, he'l ſooner hang; becauſe it's not of Apoſtolic Tradition; and hence it follows, as you ſhall ſee that you may hide all our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97770:61"/> Doctor's faith in a Nut's ſhell.</p>
               <p>For if he will belieue nothing that was denied in <hi>any time</hi> and by <hi>any Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> he muſt not belieue S Paul's Epiſtle to the Hebrews, James and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Epiſtles, nor the ſecond and third of S. John, nor the ſecond of S. Peter, becauſe all are denied by the Lutherans the Older Brethren of the Reformation: nor muſt he believe the Old Teſtament, denied by the Valentinians and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans; nor the Ghoſpels becauſe they were denied by the Marcioniſts, all as Good Chriſtians, as our Sectaries: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as I haue ſhewen in the 2. Chap. of the <hi>Vnerring Vnerrable Church,</hi> hardly any part of Scripture but was denied in ſom time, ſom place and by ſom Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Nor muſt he believe figurative Prefence denied by Luther and his ſect; nor the king's ſpiritual ſupremacy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by Calvin, as I have proved in my former Treatiſe; nor Epiſcopacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Presbiterians; alſo hardly any ſenſe of Scripture but was denied by ſom Chriſtians, and in ſom time; and conſequently if he will belieue no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor ſenſe of Scripture, but what is believed by all Chriſtians, in all times
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97770:61"/> and places, his faith will ſhrink to the bulk of a <hi>grain of Muſtard,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants may expect he will with it, <hi>moue mountains,</hi> and work other Miracles in confirmation of their new Religion.</p>
               <p>But wee are not to quarrel with our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> for this ridiculous Rule of faith for diſcerning Scripture and the true ſenſe of it; in quality of a Defender of his Church, he could do no leſs, wheras the 6. Article of the 39 of England ſpeakes thus <hi>In the name of holy Scriptures wee vnderſtand thoſe Canonical books of the old and new Teſtament of whoſe authority there never was any doubt in the Church, and by the word Church they mean, as the Doctor, the whole Conhregation of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: ſo that whatever Book the Lutherans, Valentinians, Calviniſts, Ebionits, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioniſts euer doubted of (and hardly</hi> any but they did) <hi>muſt be vtterly denied to be Canonical.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97770:64"/> what do you call <hi>a formal Hereſy?</hi> you anſwer in your Dedicatory Epiſtle to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> that it is an obſtinat adheſion to a Doctrin oppoſit to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But all Chriſtian Societies diſtinct from yours, and whoſe Tenets are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to yours, hold obſtinatly and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Doctrins oppoſit to Scripture; for you ſay often, that your Tenets are plainly ſet down, and their Errors cleerly convinc't by Scripture, which abounds with heavenly light to all thoſe who are not willfully obtinat; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thoſe Congrations are guilty of <hi>formal Hereſy</hi> and conſequently are not Members of the Catholic Church.</p>
               <p>Again; had our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> remember'd what he ſaid in his 10.

The Catholic Church alſo as he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges is the <hi>Pillar of Truth,</hi> and its cleer, that thoſe Chriſtian Societies taken all togither, are not the Pillar of Truth, being guilty of ſo many errors.</p>
               <p>Laſtly it's evident, and our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> will not deny it, that any congregation which holds fundamental errors againſt the chief and prime Articles of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, is no part of the Catholic Church: its no leſs evident that ſom of theſe Chriſtian Societies hold Errors not only againſt <hi>Infertor Verities</hi> but alſo againſt the Fundamental and chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Chriſtianity, as I haue proved in the <hi>Introduction</hi> of this booke and as your own Brethren the Lutheran Writers do expreſly confeſs, as you may reade in Brierlie trac. 2. c 2. ſect. 10. ſub 13. reade Samuel Huberinus (a Lutheran) his book, whoſe Title is <hi>An ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>IN my former Treatiſe I argued thus; either 'its lawfull to each one to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that ſenſe of Scripture which <hi>bona Fide,</hi> after mature conſideration and prayers to God, he thinks to be the ſenſe of the text; and if ſo all the world, tho at ears for their different Tenets, are in a good Religion; and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils haue bin raſh in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Arius, Neſtorius &amp;c. becauſe all Hereſiarcks and Heretics will ſay (and why ſhould not wee belieue them) that they judge in their Conſcience before God, their own ſenſe of Scripture is the true: Or God has required of vs, that wee ſhould all believe and profeſs one only ſenſe of Scripture; that, and no other, which he has reuealed; and if ſo; certainly he has apointed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97770:67"/> ſom ſupream Authority for to teach vs what ſenſe of Scripture is that which he will haue vs belieue; and wee are bound to acquieſce and yeld to that ſupream authority, tho the ſenſe he propoſes, may not ſeem to our privat judgement to be the beſt: for if God has not appointed ſuch an Authority, how ſhall I know, which of the different ſenſes giuen to the text, is that which God has reuealed: and if wee be not obliged in conſcience to obey that Authority, and belieue the ſenſe propoſed by it; then I may, and ſo may euery other, without any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reject that ſenſe, and each one hold his own, and ſo there will be no imaginable way for vs to be of one and the ſame faith. This ſupream Authority I proved to be the Church, and I haue no anſwer from my D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to all my diſcours but a very civil complement pag 29. he ſaies; if he thinks Scripture is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for to decide our Controverſies, wee will admit with S. Auguſtin, the Authority of the Church, and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as expounded by <hi>Lirinenſis:</hi> But this compliance to my diſcours ſignifies nothing, if by <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97770:67"/> Underſtands all Chriſtian Societies; for if wee muſt belieue no ſenſe of the text but what they all agree in, we muſt belieue none at all. I proued by convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that this <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Propoſing</hi> Church muſt be the Roman Catholic Church; and my D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> anſwers, that <hi>Iam a fool</hi> as <hi>the great Turk for calling himſelf king of kings:</hi> aſſuredly this is a ſhort and ſmart methode of anſwering, had Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin and ſtillingfleet diſcouered this methode of anfwering, they might haue reduced their great books to a few ſheets of paper.</p>
               <p>I proued our obligation of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Doctrin of this ſupream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; becauſe Chriſt laid his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, not only vpon the Apoſtles, but alſo vpon their ſucceſſors in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, of preaching, teaching and ruling the flock; and laid his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on the flock not only of the Apoſtles daies, but on the flock of all ſucceeding ages, of hearing, believing, and obeying their Paſtors and Leaders, for to be conueyed all into one faith: Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> anſwers in the tone of a graue man; <hi>What he ads of Obedience due from the flock to their Paſtors, is right, ſpeaking of each
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97770:68"/> flock in regard of their ordinary lawfull Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:</hi> This reſtriction, <hi>ſpeaKing of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary lawfull Paſtors,</hi> was foiſted in for ſom miſchief: doubtleſs it was to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the flock of England from any Obedience to the Pope.</p>
               <p>But Pray D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> when Luther and his merry Companions began to vent their Novelties, was there not a Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and conſequently Ordinary and lawfull Paſtors, to whom they owed Obedience? were they not obliged to obey thoſe Ordinary lawfull Paſtors, and acquieſce to their Doctrin as Chriſt commands vs by S. Paul, that wee <hi>liue in Vnity of faith</hi> and not be <hi>carried away with euery wind of Doctrin?</hi> were they not then, Schiſmatics, for not ſubmitting to thoſe lawfull Paſtors? this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſubmitting to that Authority deſcended to the Lutherans; for that Church and Authority which he was obliged to obey is ſtill the ſame; and has ſtill the right of exacting obedience from the flock; conſequently the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans are Schiſmatics for not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to it: and if the Lutherans be guilty, the Church of England is no leſs; becauſe you were then vnder the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97770:68"/> ſame Authotity and ordinary Paſtors, to which you owed Obedience, and therefore you are obliged to return.</p>
               <p>It was to eneruat this diſcours that my Antagoniſt inſerted that word, that each particular flock owes obedience <hi>to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir lawfull Ordinary Paſtors;</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Church or flock of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land owes Obedience only to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of England; that as the king in each kingdom is the head of the Church ſo the Paſtors of each kingdom are the lawfull Ordinary Paſtors in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to whom the flock owes Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; the flock of England muſt obey the Paſtots of England; the flock of France, the Paſtors of France and ſo of the reſt. And if you aſk what way imaginable is there then, to keep vs in Vnity of faith; for it may happen that the Paſtors of England, France, and Spain may deliuer different Doctrins; the one believe the Divinity of Chriſt, the other deny it; the one belieue the true Canon of Scripture and the other deny it: this may, and does happen; in this caſe all the flock of theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are obliged to haue one and the ſame faith: which Paſtors muſt they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97770:69"/> belieue? does reaſon or Scripture ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the flock of Spain to belieue the Paſtors of France? or that of France the Paſtors of England? No: why then in this caſe you haue nothing to anſwer, but that each flock is bound to obey their own Ordinary Domeſtic Paſtors, and ſo be all of three different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions one from an other; or that there is one Paſtor aboue them all, to which as well the flock as the Paſtors are bound to ſubmit, and obey.</p>
               <p>And this wee will proue out of the Church of England: for, in Ireland as there is in each Pariſh a Paſtor to watch ouer the flock; ſo there is in each Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoprick a Biſhop to rule the ſubordinat Paſtors; in each Province there is an ArchBiſhop whoſe care is to keep Vnitie of Doctrin and Diſciplin among the Biſhops; in the kingdom there is a Primat who has a ſupream Juriſdiction ouer all the Paſtors and Prelats. Now as Controverſies may arriſe betwixt the Paſtors of one kingdom, ſo there may betwixt the Paſtors of different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; why therefore, as beſides Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Chriſt our <hi>inviſible</hi> head you admit a ſupream <hi>viſible</hi> head ouer all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97770:69"/> the Paſtors of each kingdom, will not you grant a viſible Vniverſal Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ouer all the flock of Chriſt and ouer all the Paſtors of different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for to keep them in Unity of Doctrin: for if you read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you ſhall not find that Chriſt ſhould have made any mention of any particular Paſtor for each particular flock; but he made mention of One ſupream Paſtor for to gouern his whole flock, <hi>Vnum Ouile &amp; Vnus Paſtor:</hi> this One flock which Chriſt ſpoke of, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is compoſed of all the particular flocks of divers kingdoms; therefore that <hi>one Paſtor,</hi> which he ſpoke of is the Paſtor of all kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The Church of England, and our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> pag. 60. tells vs <hi>Inferior or Not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> Truths implicitly contained in Scripture, are of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to our ſaluation, that it is a damnable error to deny them; that all Nations are obliged to belieue them when they are ſufficiently propoſed to vs, to be revealed Truths; ſurely theſe Truths were revealed that they might be propoſed to, and belieued by all Nations: therefore God has apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97770:70"/> ſom Authority in the Church for to propoſe vnto all Nations, and oblige them all to belieue thoſe Truths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by that Authority: there muſt be therefore ſom Authority which has a power ouer all Nations; but the Paſtors of any particular kingdom are not impower'd to oblige the flock of an other kingdom; therfore there muſt be one Paſtor who has Authority and power ouer all. Nor will it be a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer to ſay that God gaue the Scripture to all Nations, wherby to learn all Truth; firſt becauſe beſides Scripture, its needfull that in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kingdom there be one ſupream Paſtor, who has authority ouer all the Paſtors of that kingdom, as wee haue diſcourſed but now; ſo likewiſe beſides Scripture there muſt be one ſupream Paſtor, whoſe charge is to teach and rule all Paſtors of all Nations; for Chriſt gaue his commiſſion for to teach certain Truths of Religion to all Nations; <hi>Ite, praedicate Evangelium Omni creaturae, in Vniverſum mundum;</hi> as therefore for to teach Particular kingdoms, you grant beſides Scripture, one Supream Paſtor in that kingdom; why not one Supream
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97770:70"/> Paſtor ouer all kingdoms? Secondly, its not a Scripture or a Written book which Chriſt gaue to teach; (for as I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucd in my former Treatiſe, Chriſt gaue no Scripture, nor any Commiſſion to his Apoſtles to write it;) but Liuing Paſtors and teachers: thirdly I haue proued and its evident that Scripture does not contain all Truths which all Nations are obliged to belieue: laſtly becauſe the true Canon itſelf of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is doubted of by many Nations: there muſt be then a ſupream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for to anſwer to this doubt, to whom all Nations are obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce. This ſupream Authority was belieued by the Chriſtian World to be in the Pope and Council before Luther and Calvins revolt, to this Authority they gaue obedience then, and now they deny it; they are therefore guilty of Schiſm, and bound to return to that Obedience.</p>
               <p>I proued in my former Treatiſe of this ſubject that it was the practice of Gods Church in all ages, when euer any Controverſy in Religion arriſed betwixt two Parties; it was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by their altercations, diſputes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97770:71"/> and Interpretations of the Text; but the queſtion was deuolued to the Church conven'd in a General Council, to which both Parties were obliged to ſubmit, and he eſteemed an Heretic who would not acquieſce to the Deciſion of the Council: That no Apellation nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt the Council vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being a Partie, or of being of the contrarie Doctrin to the Perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, was admitted; but he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſubmit his Doctrin to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Council. I proued alſo at large that this was the practice of the Reformed Church, in the Synods of <hi>Dordrect</hi> and <hi>Delph</hi> in Holland; where <hi>Arminius</hi> proteſted againſt the Synod, as being a Partie becauſe it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the moſt part of <hi>Gomariſts:</hi> but the Synod declared him a Schiſmatic, if he did not waue his Apellation, and ſubmit himſelf to its Judgment in that Controverſy, and declared itſelf to be the competent Judge in that cauſe. I inferred hence, the obligation of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the whole Reformation that he ought to haue ſubmitted himſelf to the Church convened in the Council of Trent, to which the Deciſion of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97770:71"/> Controverſies apertained. My good D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> anſwers pag. 31. that the Pope and Council of Trent, were the Partie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; that Luther nor the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not therefore, nor ought not to ſubmit vnto them: this was the anſwer of Arminius to <hi>Dordrect.</hi> And Dordrect judged him to be a Schiſmatic for ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering; this was the anſwer of Arius and all Heretics againſt the Councils who condemned them; and they were judged Schiſmatics for not ſubmitting; and muſt not our Doctor alſo be judged a Schiſmatic with his Maſter Luther, if they do not waue this Proteſtation.</p>

For the Apoſtles were not only <hi>Vnerring,</hi> but alſo <hi>Vnerrable</hi> in what they writ; other wiſe Scripture would not be Gods <hi>Infallible</hi> Word: and who can deny but that they were as infallible in what they taught verbally, as in what they writ? wheras S. Paul ſaies Gal. 1. 8. that the word he preached to them, was not of man, but of God. The ſame wee muſt ſay of the Church: firſt becauſe no text of Scripture does warrant the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Apoſtles (as wee haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in my former Treatiſe and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the next enſuing Chapter) that does not alſo warrant the Infallibility of the Church: Secondly you grant the Church is <hi>Gods Vnerring Oracle,</hi> that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97770:76"/> by the aſſiſtance of Gods H.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97770:76"/> relates the one half of my words: but that my Reader may judge if my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be as ridiculous, as my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt is deſingenuous, I will propoſe my diſcours which was thus: If wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the teſtimonies of Scripture, the conſent of ages, the multitude of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> and fathers, which teach <hi>Infallibility;</hi> its as likely (to ſay no more) that you are miſtaken in believing Church <hi>Fallibility,</hi> as that I am miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in belieuing <hi>Infallibilitie:</hi> as to the truth therefore of this Doctrin you haue no more aſſurance of the truth of your Tenet than I have of mine: thus far we are equal: but I haue a huge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in believing the Doctrin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility which you cannot haue in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing fallibility; for <hi>faith</hi> is our roade to ſaluation, you trauel in one faith or roade, I trauel in an other, wee are doubtfull of the roade; my advantage is, that I am guided by a Church which I firmly belieue and am fully aſſured is infallible, cannot err, cannot be miſtaken, cannot byaſs me: I am like a Traveller, who tho he does not know the roade, he is fully perſwaded, and without the leaſt doubt that his guide
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97770:77"/> who vndertakes to leade him is ſo knowing in the way that he cannot miſs it; the Traveller goes on in his journy, follows his guide, his mind is at reſt, he is fully ſatisfied, and has not the leaſt feare of being byaſs'd: ſo a Catholic being fully perſwaded and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing the Infallibility of his Church, liues with a quiet mind free from doubts and fear of going aſtray becauſe he is perſwaded the Church which guides him cannot err; and tho really the Tavellers guide were not ſo throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the roade, but that he may ſtray, yet the Traveller being fully perſwaded that he cannot; travells with ſatisfaction without any feare or doubt.</p>
               <p>But if a Traveller did not know the roade, and were perſwaded that the guide which leads him, is not ſo expert but that he may go aſtray; truly he muſt be allwaies fearfull, dubious, and without reſt of mind, doubtfull if he goes well, or if he be by aſs'd. So it is with the Proteſtant in his faith which is the roade to, Saluation he knows not the way well; he is guided by a Church, which he belieues may err in the roade,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97770:77"/> ought not he to live and walk in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual feare? Hence I inferred that any wiſe man ought to chooſe the Doctrin of Infallibility before that of fallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for in believing Infallibility he does not hazard his ſaluation, becauſe in the actual Profeſſion of our Roman Tenets a man may be ſaued, ſaie the Proteſtants; ſecondly becauſe in the belief of fallibilitie it's as likely the Proteſtants are deceiued, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics in believing Infallibility: the Catholics run no greater hazard of believing an vntruth, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; <hi>it may be</hi> (the Proteſtant will ſay) <hi>there is no ſuch thing really, as Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility; and ſo the Catholics wil be deceiued. And it may be,</hi> ſaies the Catholic to the Proteſtant, <hi>ther's no ſuch thing as fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſo you will be deceiued: and ſince I hazard nothing by it, and I am as likely to belieue a true Doctrin as you; why will not I chooſe the Tenet of Infallibility, which giues me reſt of mind without any doubt or feare in the full aſſurance of the truth I profeſs; rather than your Tenet of fallibility, which leaues you doubtfull and ſuſpenſe if what you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, be true or fals; if the roade you walk in, be the right roade or no?</hi> Let my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97770:78"/> be judge if this diſcours be ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall thought to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it;</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97770:78"/> the bnginning was ſettled in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Chriſt's true Doctrin; (for the Proteſtants acknowledge, ſhee wee once the true Church,) that Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſed her the conduct of his aſſiſting ſpirit <hi>vntill the Conſummation of the world,</hi> and that the gates of Hell ſhould not prevaile againſt her. By virtue of this promiſs ſhe continued her poſſeſſion by your acknowledgment, for many ages: ſhee was attackt by ſeveral Heretics from time to time, accuſing her to haue fallen from the truth: ſhe was hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie diſcharged by General Councils, and never yet condemned by any; but her Title approued and her poſſeſſion continued.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97770:79"/> are appliable, and if they proue infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie; they proue that of the Chuch: but let vs hear ſom of thoſe texts; the firſt is that of Math. 16. <hi>vpon his Rock (meaning Peter) I wil build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt her.</hi> What Church is that which Chriſt built vpon Peter? is it the Apoſtles alone? or his <hi>Vniverſal</hi> Church, which was to continue in ſucceeding Ages after them? if <hi>the Apoſtles;</hi> then you muſt acknowledge (and that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants will be loath to do) that Peter is the foundation, head, and chief of the Apoſtles, that their faith is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon him: If the <hi>Church Vniverſall,</hi> which was to continue in ſucceeding ages? then the text is appliable to the Church, and by it wee are aſſured, that the <hi>gates of Hell,</hi> that's to ſay Error or Hereſy, ſhall not prevaile againſt her; which is to be infallible.</p>
               <p>An other Text Jo. 14. <hi>If you ask any thing in my name I will do it; and I will pray the father; and he will giue you an other Comforter that will abide with you for euer, euen the ſpirit of Truth.</hi> Three things are promiſed by this Text: and all three appliable to the Church in all ages, as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97770:80"/> well as to the Apoſtles: the firſt is; <hi>If you ask any thing in my name I will do it.</hi> This promiſs vndoubtedly relates to the whole Church, and it were ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and erroneous to ſay that it was made to the Apoſtles and to none els. The ſecond; <hi>If you lone me keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi> was this ſaid to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles alone? was the obſervance of the Commandments required only of them in teſtimonie of their loue? The third; <hi>and I will pray my father, and he will giue you an other Comforter who will abide with you for euer, euen the ſpirit of Truth.</hi> If theſe words be appliable to the Church, its evident the text proues the Infallibilitie of the Church, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly as that of the Apoſtles; And that thoſe words are appliable to the Church, it ſeems vndoubted ſince that the precedent words of the ſame text are appliable to her; particularly that the later words import the Comforter's abyding <hi>for euer</hi> which cannot be ſaid of the Apoſtles own perſons, who were not to be <hi>for euer;</hi>

               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:97770:81"/>
               <p>And what is to be admired is, that our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> brings no kind of proof, for to proue that theſe texts are not appliable to the Church, but his word, and a little quillet which weighs as little as his word: for I quoted a text out of S.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>monie.</hi> From which text I argued thus: the wittneſſes apointed by Chriſt to give teſtimonie of him and his Doctrin were the ſpirit of God, and the Church; the teſtimony proceeds from both joyntly, from the Paraclet inwardly inſpiring, and the Church outwardly declaring; therefore this teſtimonie is infalliblie true: No, quoth our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> the texts relate only to the Apoſtles; and not at all to the Church: no man in his ſenſes will ſay otherwiſe: and why ſo? Becauſe, ſaies he, the Apoſtles only and not the Church, <hi>were with Chriſt ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and the text in its laſt words ſaies they were to giue teſtimonie of him, <hi>who were with him from the beginning,</hi> which laſt words of the text, he ſaies, I fraudulently left out, and corrupted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97770:81"/> the text: Reader I'l be judged by you if our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> has not loſt his ſenſes as well as his reaſon; <hi>Only the Apoſtles he ſates, were the witneſſes apointed by Chriſt for to giue teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonie of Chriſt, becauſe they alone were with him from the beginning, No man in his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will ſay other wiſe.</hi> Therefore the Church of England giues no teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Chriſt nor his Doctrin, becauſe ſhe was not with Chriſt from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Nor S. Paul was with Chriſt from the beginning; nor the four firſt General Councils; nor a word of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore none of them were competent witneſſes for to give teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Chriſt or his Doctrin; <hi>No man in his ſenſes will ſay they were.</hi> And by this you may ſee it was neither fraud nor deprauation of the text made me omit thoſe laſt words of the text, but becauſe they did not concern the controverſy in hand. And this little quillet is all the anſwer wee haue from him to proue thoſe texts are not appliable to the Church.</p>
               <p>If our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> did contradict but in the end of his book what he ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it; it would be pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but to tell vs in his 7. Chapt. that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97770:82"/> the texts importing Infallibilitie are not at all appliable to the Church: and then again in the ſelf ſam Chapt. to tell vs they are <hi>appliable</hi> to the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally if ſhe be in God's loue and grace; argues a mightie want of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but juſt now he ſaid, No man in his ſenſe could applie thoſe texts to the Church: the man, ſurely, has loſt his ſenſes; for pag. 44. of that Chap. he ſaies thoſe texts relate to the Church, and were pronounced by Chriſt in her favor, but ſtill conditionally that ſhe continue in Gods loue and grace: and becauſe the Church has fayled in this condition by the many crimes of her Paſtors and Prelats; ſhe has forfeited the conduct of Gods aſſiſting Spirit of Truth, and is no more infallible.</p>
               <p>From this Paradox it follows that thoſe Promiſſes were alſo <hi>Conditional</hi> in regard of the Apoſtles; for neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor any thing but a groundleſs fancy can perſuade, that thoſe Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were <hi>Abſolut</hi> in regard of the One; and <hi>Conditional</hi> only in regard of the other: read the Texts and you ſhall ſee it: and wheras in the Apoſtles time there were many and grieveous ſinners
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97770:82"/> in the Church, (tho they were Saints themſelves) it follows that the Church in their time did forfeit her Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie becauſe ſhe was not in the loue of God, and obſervance of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Secondly it follows the Church now has not the Aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit in fundamental Points, and ſo ſhe is fallible in them; which Proteſtants will not ſay: thirdly it follows the four firſt General Councils had not that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which is contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the Church of England.</p>
               <p>But let vs proue directly the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of this conditional Promiſs: This Propoſition is now abſolutly true, and independently of any condition; <hi>The Church is the Pillar and foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Truth;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſins of Paſtors and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, this propoſition is true; as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall himſelf confeſſes as well in his Sermon, as in his Book: alſo he ſaies in his 15. pag. againſt J. S. that the Church, tho it be not properly infallible yet it ſhall not err in fundamental Doctrin, becauſe the Church Vniverſal has, and is to haue the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church now, notwithſtanding all the ſins and tranſgreſſions of our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97770:83"/> Paſtors and prelates, has the Aſſiſtance of Gods infallible ſpirit; for if you take the Church ſeparatly from the Aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit; it is not, nor can it be called The <hi>Pillar of Truth:</hi> ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is now truly the Pillar of Truth notwithſtanding all our ſins; it has now the Aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our ſins; therefore that Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Gods ſpirit was not promiſed <hi>Conditionally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what is execrable to be ſaid (as I obſerved in my former Treatiſe) is, that if Gods promiſs of his aſſiſting infallible ſpirit, be only <hi>conditional,</hi> wee cannot be ſure that the Ghoſpels are infallible: for if the Evangeliſts when they writ them were not in the ſtate of Grace, they had not the aſſiſtance of Gods infallible ſpirit; as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaies; and in the principles of the Church of England nothing aſſures vs that they were in the ſtate of Grace then; for Proteſtants will take nothing for ſure but what's expreſſed in Scripture; and no text of Scripture mentions their being then in the ſtate of Grace: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently nothing aſſures vs that the Ghoſpels are infallible. Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> rings a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97770:83"/> greate peale of inſolent impietie againſt me for this execrable Poſition, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aſſures vs the Evangeliſts were in the ſtate of Grace;</hi> the cenſure of inſolent impietie is moſt deſervedly paſt; but its not pardonable, that the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſhould lay it at my doore, the Poſition not being mine, but an vnauoidable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele out of his Church's Principles.</p>
               <p>As it is an vnauoidable ſequele out of their Principles, that wee are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Ghoſpels are not infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Evangeliſts in the principles of the Proteſtant Church were not in the ſtate of Grace; wheras it's the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrin, that it's impoſſible to keep Gods Commandments. Heer our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> will daſh out my brains, (if ratling can do it) for ſo great a Calumnie: <hi>he neuer heard any Proteſtant vtter ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat a Poſition.</hi> Haply he did not; he is but a yong Proteſtant.

               </head>
               <p>IUndertook to prove in the 8. Chap. of my former Treatiſe that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church is not the Church of Chriſt nor any part of it, becauſe it does
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97770:85"/> not teach his Doctrin; and no Church can be called the Church of Chriſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it teachs his Doctrin: That Proteſtancy or Doctrin of the Proteſtant Church, as it is condiſtinct from Cathole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, or the Doctrin of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, is not the Doctrin of Chriſt nor any part of it, I proved it with this ſyllogiſm in <hi>Ferio.</hi> No fallible Doctrin is the Doctrin nor any part of the Doctrin of Chriſt; but Proteſtancy as it is condiſtinct from Catholeciſm, (that's to ſay the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin wherin they differ from vs, and for which they ſeparated from vs) is altogither fallible Doctrin; therefore Proteſtancy is not the Doctrin nor any part of the Doctrin of Chriſt. That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy is altogither fallible Doctrin, I proued it; becauſe the Doctrin wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Proteſtants differ from vs, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither of <hi>Inferior Verities, of Points not fundamental;</hi> This, no ingenuos Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant will ſtick to grant; for its the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs confeſſion of Proteſtants, that Catholics and Proteſtans agree in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points; and therefore they pretend wee are all of one Religion as to the ſubſtance, and that wee may be ſaued in our Religion, becauſe our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97770:85"/> 
                  <hi>Errors</hi> are only in <hi>Inferior</hi> and <hi>not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Doctrin, which ſhocks not the foundation of Religion; But the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of <hi>Inferior Verities,</hi> and Points <hi>not fundamental</hi> is altogither fallible Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin; Nor will any Proteſtant deny this Propoſition who vnderſtands well the Doctrin of his Church; for its the conſtant Doctrin of Proteſtants, and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall himſelf ſaies it pag. 15. againſt J. S. that the Church cannot err in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points of faith, but that it may and has erred in points not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental or Inferior Truths. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Proteſtancie or the Doctrin wherin Proteſtants differ from vs is but falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrin, and conſequently not the Doctrin of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It's a pittifull thing to ſee how my poor D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is entangled in this argument: his firſt, and beſt anſwer is to ſay my <hi>Theſis is Inſolent, and a big promiſing Title;</hi> but if his anſwer be not good, it will proue as <hi>performing</hi> as it is <hi>promiſing:</hi> let vs hear his anſwer: <hi>He will haue vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>that Proteſtants alow Papiſts not to err in points fundamental.</hi> What ſhufling, and ambiguous terms be theſe? <hi>He will haue vs premiſs;</hi> what? do you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97770:86"/> think I beg that of you as a favor? is it not your own acknowledgement in your Dedicatory Epiſtle to the Earl of Eſſex, that the Church of Rome was once the true Church? is it not alſo your ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgement pag. 15. that the true Church is to have the continual aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Holy Ghoſt for not to err in fundamental points of Religion? do not you acknowledge in the beginning of your book that Roman Catholics may be ſaved in their Religion? and can any be ſaved in the profeſſion of fundamental errors? I proued in my former treatiſe that almoſt all your ſectaries confeſs rhis truth, and it is the conſtant Doctrin of the Church of England.</p>
               <p>He goes on, but quite out of the Road, and tells vs, <hi>that fundamental points are thoſe which are contained in the Creed;</hi> and this is nothing to our purpoſe; for to anſwer my argument, it matters not a pin's head to know where the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points are contained; or what they are; what avails vs, is to know that the Doctrin wherin you differ from vs, is only the Doctrin of, <hi>not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points:</hi> after his long rambling he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97770:86"/> comes at laſt to my ſyllogiſm: He grants the Major propoſition, <hi>that no fallible Doctrin is the Doctrin of Chriſt;</hi> he denies the Minor, <hi>that Proteſtancy is all fallible Doctrin:</hi> to the ſecond Syllogiſm he, gives me for granted (and no thanks to him for it) <hi>that Proteſtancy, or Doctrin wherin they differ from vs is altogither of points not fundamental;</hi> but the Minor ſtings him, <hi>that the Doctrin of points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental is fallible Doctrin; ſtop heer,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>and an eternal ſtop ſhould be put to your tongue:</hi> but what will it availe you to ſtop my tongue, if you do not cut of my fingars? and why muſt my poor tongue be ſtopt? becauſe he ſaies it's a formal blaſphemy to ſay the Doctrin of points not fundamental, or Inferior Truths is fallible: Indeed? and why is it a blaſphemy? becauſe quoth he, <hi>it's to ſay the Word of God is fallible, for inferior Verities are implicitly contained in God's Written Word and Tradition.</hi> Stop heer D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and an eternal ſtop ſhould be put to your Logic: my Argument is this; Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Verities are fallible Doctrin and therefore not the Word of God, nor to be found in Scripture; and you anſwer me, Inferior Verities are infallible Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97770:87"/> becauſe they are Gods Word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture: is this your Logic? to give your Concluſion in debate, for a reaſon? you challenge me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge often in my book, that points not fundamental are Inferior Verities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Word of God: for ſhame D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>; you impoſe vpon me, and deceive your Reader; you ſhall not find any ſuch acknowledgment in all my book; nay pag. 147. of the <hi>Vnerring Vnerrable Church,</hi> I deny any diſtinction of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental and not fundamental points in our Catholic Principles'; becauſe any Doctrin which is ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vs to be a revealed Truth, is to vs a fundamental point of neceſſarie belief to ſaluation; and whatever Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin is not ſufficiently propoſed to be a revealed Truth, is neither a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or not fundamental point of faith.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſee how did I prove the Doctrin of points not fundamental and inferior Truths to be fallible Doctrin; for in this conſiſts the force of my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I proued it by the Proteſtants own Principles, for the Church, ſay they, can err, and hath err'd in the Doctrin of points not fundamental; therefore
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97770:87"/> the Doctrin of points not fundamental is fallible; conſequently not the Doctrin of Chriſt: Obſerve Reader, that my Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not, as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> diſingenuouſly draws it <hi>The Church can err in teaching points not fundamental, therefore points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental are in themſelves fallible.</hi> No, that's not my conſequence; but thus: The true Church may err in teaching points not fundamental; therefore the Doctrin or teaching (mark I ſay the <hi>Doctrin,</hi> not the points themſelues) of thoſe points not fundamental, is fallible and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not the Doctrin of Chriſt: for that a Doctrin may be truly called the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of Chriſt, its not enough that the points delivered and propoſed be in themſelves objectively true, but that the propoſal, teaching and deliverance of them by the Inſtructor or Teacher be infallibly true; becauſe our Act of faith or aſſent to Chriſt's Doctrin is infallibly true, and this infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, is not bottom'd only on the objective real truth of the points propoſed, but on the Authority of the Proponent or Teacher; its therefore requiſit he be infallible in teaching.</p>
               <p>And that you may ſee howfar he is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97770:88"/> com ſhort of anſwering my ſyllogiſm, I will ſhew you how he plainly grants all that I pretended to proue by it: for as well in his 10. Chapt. where he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to anſwer it, as in his 4. Chapt. he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes <hi>Subjective</hi> and <hi>Objective</hi> Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie; and tho he mumbles like one that's aſham'd or a fraid to ſpeake; yet he gives vs to vnderſtand, that the Church is <hi>Objectively</hi> infallible, that's to ſay the Verities and Tenets ſhe teachs, whether <hi>fundamental</hi> or <hi>not fundamental,</hi> are certainly and infallibly true; but the Church is <hi>ſubjectively</hi> fallible; that's to ſay the <hi>Teaching, delivering</hi> and <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of thoſe Verities by the Church, is fallible: and this is a downright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of all I pretend; for I never pretended by my ſyllogiſm to proue that the Tenets, or points delivered are objectively fallible or fals; but that the Teachers in delivering them, their propoſing and Doctrin of them, is fallible; and before wee paſs further, My D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> will not take it ill, tho I be but a Maſter of Grammer, as he ſaies, to give him a peece of inſtruction which he wants: that diſtinction he makes of <hi>Objective</hi> and <hi>Subjective</hi> Infallibilitie is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97770:88"/> very improper, and reliſhes nothing of a ſchoolma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the <hi>Obiects</hi> in themſelves are not <hi>fallible</hi> or <hi>infallible, Probable</hi> or <hi>Evident;</hi> wee do not ſay <hi>This is a Probable ſtone,</hi> or <hi>this is a fallible hors:</hi> thoſe terms are not appliable to the objects <hi>a parte rei;</hi> but to the Vital intellectual Acts of our mind, which tend to the Objects: only the propoſitions or Acts of our vnderſtanding which wee elicit on the Objects, are ſaid to be fallible, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, probable, or improbable; and ſo our D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> diſtinction of <hi>Objective</hi> and <hi>Subjective</hi> infallibilitie, is pure non ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But ſince it has been our D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> bad luck to hit on this diſtinction, wee will make it ſerue for to better our cauſe; he grants therefore that the Church is <hi>ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely fallible:</hi> I'l propoſe him an other ſyllogiſm and it ſhall be in <hi>Ferio,</hi> for I ſee he is vnluckie in that figure and Mode: <hi>No Church Subiectively fallible, that's to ſay in teaching and delivering her Doctrin, is the Church of Chriſt; But the Proteſtant Church, as our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> confeſſes now, and I hope will remember it next yeare, is ſubiectively fallible in teaching her Doctrin; therfore the Proteſtant Church is not the</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:97770:89"/> 
                  <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi> I proue the Major propoſition: <hi>The Church of God is to be believed before an Angel, who would teach vs the contrarie Doctrin to what ſhe delivers,</hi> as S. Paul ſaies Gal. 1. 8. <hi>But if the Church were fallible in teaching, wee ought to believe an Angel rather than the Church:</hi> therefore the Church is not ſubjectively fallible. That an Angel is to be believed before any fallible Church, it's manifeſt: for that Church <hi>ſubiectively</hi> fallible muſt not have the aſſiſtance of Gods infallible ſpirit in teaching; if it were guided by Gods ſpirit when it teachs it could not err; it muſt be a congregation of men, left to their own wiſdom and prudence for to deliver what they judge to be the beſt Doctrin: and who doubts but that an Angels judgment, which is of ſo ſublime and piercing an vnderſtanding, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably ſurpaſſing all human intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, is to be preferred before the opinion of all congregations of men?</p>
               <p>By the way let me aſk my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; Is his Church fallible <hi>ſubiectively</hi> in teaching <hi>fundamental</hi> points? probably he will ſay, No, for pag. 15. he tells vs, <hi>the Church is to have the aſsiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt in fundamental points:</hi> It is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97770:89"/> ſubjectively fallible therefore only in teaching <hi>Not fundamental</hi> and <hi>Inferior Truths;</hi> which is the Doctrin wherin Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants differ from vs; therefore the Church of England has not the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt in teaching what Doctrin ſhe differs in from vs (for to be fallible in teaching, and not to have the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, is the ſame thing) therefore the Church of England does not teach the Doctrin of Chriſt when ſhe teachs <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior truths;</hi> now it remains, that our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> tell vs, by what ſpirit is his Church guided and inſpired in teaching Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Truths wherin they differ, and for which they have ſeparated from vs; if ſhe be not inſpired and guided by the ſpirit of God?</p>
               <p>I prove again that <hi>Major</hi> propoſition, tbat no Church <hi>Subiectiuely</hi> fallible is the Church of Chriſt; The Church of Chriſt eſſentially requires not only Divin Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities objectiuely infallible, but Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers infallible in teaching, propoſing, and delivering them to vs; I proue it; for, the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaies, is <hi>Written;</hi> (which is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and Vnwritten (that is <hi>Tradition)</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:97770:90"/> both are of equal infallibilitie; God's <hi>Written</hi> Word is not only infallible <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectively</hi> in the Verities it containes; but alſo <hi>ſubiectively</hi> in the <hi>Recitall, Relation,</hi> and <hi>rehears</hi> of them to vs; otherwiſe what reſpect would there be due of vs to Scripture, more than to any other profane book, which would contain thoſe Verities; or to our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theciſms, and Commentaries vpon Scripture: therefore Gods <hi>Vnwritten</hi> Word, or Tradition is not only <hi>obiective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> infallible in the Verities it contains; but alſo <hi>ſubiectiuely</hi> infallible in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, teaching and propoſing of thoſe Verities vnto vs; this <hi>Relation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal</hi> and deliverance of theſe Verities is the Doctrin of the Church, which hands them from age to age to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; therefore the true Church is not only <hi>Obiectiuely,</hi> but alſo <hi>Subiectiuely</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>

               <p>ANcient fathers and Divins were ſo deeply perſwaded of the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut and infallible certainty of Divin faith, that it was the common Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim among them, <hi>Scientia plus habet lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, ſed fides plus habet firmitatis &amp; adhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis: Science</hi> has more of light and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuitie, but faith has more certaintie and aſſurance; for, all the certaintie that <hi>Science</hi> has, is grounded vpon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature; and that of faith vpon Divin Authority, which ſurmounts the certainty and aſſurance that Nature can give: that Proteſtants haue not this certaintie in their faith, I proued it in my former Treatiſe, bccauſe they reſt their faith vpon Scripture as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by them, and tho Scripture, rightly vnderſtood be infallibly true,

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97770:91"/> (for example) his Son's Incarnation? <hi>Wee haue a moral certainty,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>which ioyned with an abſolut certaintie, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God revealed, is true; makes vp all the certaintie a pious and prudent Believer ought to deſire:</hi> I am much miſtaken if I will not evidence, that our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> has not a crumm of Divin faith: for heer is his Belief; He has <hi>Abſolut infallible</hi> certainty that Chriſt's Incarnation is true, if God revealed it; and this is no faith, but meer <hi>Science:</hi> He has no <hi>Abſolut infallible</hi> certaintie that God revealed the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; he has but <hi>Moral certaintie</hi> of it; ſo that the act of faith wherwith he believes the Incarnation, is but <hi>Morally</hi> certain; but a faith only Morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is no Divin faith; for take Moral certainty in it's higheſt pitch you can imagin, it implies a poſſibilitie of being fals; for example, that there is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom extant called England, from which wee departed but three daies ago; is ſo morally certain, that it excludes all reaſonable doubts of it's being true; yet in effect its poſſible there may be no ſuch kingdom, but drown'd all in water: ſo that Moral certaintie, tho it excludes all reaſonable doubts of its objects
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97770:92"/> exiſtence; yet it does not aſſure vs that the object cannot be otherwiſe than as it affirms; but an act of Divin faith is of a heigher certaintie, for it not only aſſures vs of its object's being ſo, but that it cannot be otherwiſe; it not only excludes all doubts of its objects not being; but it excludes all thoughts of judging the object can be otherwiſe than as it repreſents it to be: what is Morally certain is true, and can in effect be fals; what is of Divin faith is true, and cannot be fals: therefore what is only morally certain is not Divin faith. That an Act of faith is not only true, but that it cannot be fals; it's lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that blind paſſion, and a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat engagement in an error has hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men ſo far as to doubt of it: what mans heart will not tremble to think it may be fals, that the ſon of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man, that he dyed for vs, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that all the miſteries of our Religion may be fables? yet all is ſo, if faith be but Morally certain; for what is only Morally certain may be fals.</p>
               <p>And to what purpoſe do you and your Church ſo earneſtly pretend God's infallible Word for to warrant your
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97770:92"/> faith? your Reformation has from the beginning rejected Traditions as being human inventions, Fathers, Councils, conſent of ages, nothing will ſerve you for a teſt of faith, but Scripture, Gods Infallible Word; and what to do? if your faith be only Morally certain; would not a ground only Morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuffice for to reſt it on? what needs an infallible ground for a fallible Act, if that infallible ground does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat its Infallibilitie to the Act? either it gives to the Act all the aſſurance it can give it, or not? if not; what is it good for, more than a fallible ground? if it does, therefore it makes the Act abſolutly infallible.</p>
               <p>And if your faith be only morally certain, and your Church and Religion fallible; I commend the prudence of your Church in never hauing attempted the converſion of Pagans and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: for its impoſſible any wiſe man ſhould embrace your Religion, if it were propoſed vnto him in the colours wee have ſeen you ſet it out, in theſe precedent Chapters: Imagin two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Preachers did go from England with their Bible to convert the king of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97770:93"/> China, and let them preach to him, what wee have heard our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſay hitherto: S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wee are abſolutly ſure that whateuer God has revealed is true; Our faith and Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ground vpon this book, which wee belieue to be the pure Word of God, and all the contents of it are infalliblie and abſolutly true; becauſe they were revealed by him; yet it's not abſolutly certain, they were reuealed by him; but we are Morally certain of it, and therefore wee belieue them; this book ſaies, our God is one in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and three in Perſons; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon of the Trinitie became Man, dyed for vs vpon a croſs, and aroſe again from death; of all this we are only Morally certain, and wee firmly belieue it. This ſecond Perſon God and Man, eſtabliſht a Church on earth wherin his Doctrin and faith ſhould be taught, wherof his Apoſtles were the chief Maſters; he gave to this Church in his Apoſtles time; his infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit for to lead and conduct her into all truth; but ſoon after the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles time, he withdrew from the Church his Infallible Spirit, and ſhe fell into many erroneous Doctrins; and now wee
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97770:93"/> haue no other guide to direct vs, but this Bible; the ſenſe of it is very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but wee are certain, that ſenſe of it which wee hold is the true ſenſe; and of this wee have only Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie: and tho it be obſcure and the ſenſe of it ſo doubtfull, that many ſects of Chriſtians differ from vs, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it in a quite contrary ſenſe to that which wee hold; wee will admit no judge for to allay theſe doubts and decide theſe Controverſies but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſelf: There is a kind of people among vs, which they call the Popiſh Church; which was the Church eſtabliſht by the ſon of God, and was once a pure and Orthodox Church; But Martin Luther a learned man, arroſe and found that the Doctrin profeſſed by this Church for many hundred years before, was erroneous; our kingdom of England followed his example, and wee do not approve either the Doctrin of that Church; nor that of Luther; wee have made a new Reformation of both; there are many other ſects in England who have ſprung from vs, and are, as ſo many Reformations of our Church; but our Doctrin is the beſt of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97770:94"/> all, and of this wee are Morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, In the Popiſh Church there haue been in all ages many men eſteemed by the world of eminent ſanctitie, and holy life and converſation, which has gained the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of Saints through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world; wee ſay they were all hypocrits and no true Saints; and wee do confeſs ourſelves never had any man of publikly knowen Sanctitie, eſteemed ſo by the common vogue of Chriſtians; in that Church there has been in paſt ages, and in theſe laſt ages ſince wee are in the world many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſupernatural ſigns wrought by the Profeſſors of her Doctrin, in confirmation of her Tenets; and the wyſeſt men and greateſt of the world, have been eyewitneſſes of many of them, and judged them to be true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and recorded them in their books for ſuch; but wee ſay they were no true Miracles, and that ſince the Apoſtles time there has been none; it's certaine no Miracle was ever wrought in our Church: there have been very many in that Church in all precedent ages, who were eſteemed the Oracles of their times in learning, and whoſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97770:94"/> Books are highly eſteemed by vs; and wee ſay they were Ignorant Soules, becauſe they taught the Popiſh Tenets contrary to ours. This is our faith and Religion which wee are com to preach vnto you, and of all this faith, and all that wee belieue, wee have only Moral certainty: if you belieue our faith and Tenets God has promiſed, you ſhall be ſaued; and perhaps you may not be ſaved, for its but <hi>Morally</hi> certain that God has made any ſuch promiſs; and what is only <hi>Morally</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain may be fals: if you do not believe our Doctrin, but the quite contrarie you may alſo be ſaved, for wee are ſo charitable as to belieue that all the other Chriſtian Sects who hold quite contrary Tenets to ours, may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; all is but Morally certain; all may be fals.</p>
               <p>Now let my Reader conſider if all this be not pure Proteſtant Doctrin, and what wee haue heard D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall ſay in the precedent Chapters; and let him judge if the king would not be ſurpriſed at the boldneſs of theſe men in obtruding ſuch a faith vpon him, and would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them; my friends, you confeſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97770:95"/> you haue but <hi>Morall</hi> certainty of the truth of what Doctrin you deliver; and what is but only morally certain, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a poſſibilitie of being fals; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore poſſibly all you have ſaid, may be fals Doctrin, and why would you have me change my Religion for yours, which for ought you and I know, may be wors than my own: you ſay that whatever God has revealed is abſolutly and infallibly true; I do, and did ever believe the ſame; you ſay it's morally certain he revealed all the contents of your booke, I ſay alſo its morally certain he revealed all the Tenets of my Religion; If God has withdrawen the conduct of his infallible Spirit from the Church, and that the Popiſh Church has fallen into ſo many Errors, you may alſo fall into as many; and I would com to be in as bad a condition in your Church, as I am in, in my own Religion: I ſee no proof you have of the truth of your Doctrin; nor any encouragement for to embrace it, not any proof, for the Bible which you ſo much eſteem, is challenged by your fellow ſectaries and by your Popiſh Church as well as by you, and what
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97770:95"/> have you, befides your bare word for to prove your ſenſe of it, is better than that of your fellows? particularly that you confeſs I may be ſaved by believing their ſenſe of it, as well as by believing yours: and if your God has left no Judge to decide your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and who by a definitive Sentence ſhould declare, which is the true ſenſe of it; it's a mark that he is equally pleaſed with any ſenſe that is given and believed of it; or if; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to oblige all to be of one ſenſe and meaning of that Bible, he muſt haue apointed ſom judge for to declare what ſenſe is that: neither do I ſee any encouragement you give me to embrace your Religion; for its no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it beyond the Popiſh Church, which you haue forſaken, to tell me that you never had any Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that the Popiſh had; which tho you ſay, they were no true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; yet you confeſs many eſteemed by yourſelves to have been eminent men in learning, and eſteemed by your forefathers to have been no leſs emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in ſanctitie; that theſe men I ſay have judged them to be true Miracles;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97770:96"/> and why ſhould not I believe their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion before yours: finally ſince you acknowledge there is but Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, both of the truth of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of ſaluation in the belief of thoſe Truths; what is only Morally certain, may be fals, and ſo all your Doctrin and Religion may be a meer cheat.</p>
               <p>Now you ſhall ſee Reader how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is to perſwade any Pagan to Chriſtianity, or any Chriſtian to piety by the Letter of Scripture which the Reformation vſes: you muſt know, that the Reformation thought it needfull to reform the <hi>Letter</hi> of Scripture, as well as the ſenſe of it; and purge the Bible of ſom words <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſmelt as they judged, of Popery; and ſubſtitute in their place new terms; for examble inſteed of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> they put <hi>Elders;</hi> for <hi>Church</hi> they put <hi>Synagogue;</hi> for <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> put <hi>Holy Wind;</hi> for <hi>Chriſt, Anoynted;</hi> for <hi>Our Lord and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Baal and rayn;</hi> for <hi>Baptiſm, Waſhing;</hi> for <hi>Soul Carcas;</hi> for <hi>Grave, Hell;</hi> for <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament Secret;</hi> for <hi>Altar, Table;</hi> for <hi>Beelzebub, Lord of a fly;</hi> for <hi>Angels, Meſſengers:</hi> this famous exchange of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97770:96"/> terms, you ſhall find in their Ancient Bibles, particularly of Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and before her time; now they are aſhamed of them, as Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> obſerves, who diſcourſes wittily vpon this ſubject thus.</p>
               <p>Let a Preacher ſpeake to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in the old Catholic terms of the Bible thus; <hi>I that am a Prieſt, placed in the Church by the Holy Ghoſt, for the feeding of your ſouls, do denounce vnto you in the name of Chriſt our Lord and Maſter, that if you be not regenerated by Baptiſm; and prepared for the Sacrament of the Altar, you ſhall be condemned body and ſoul into hell, and your portion ſhall be with the Deuil, I ſay with Beelzebub and his Angels.</hi> This ſpeech indeed has good ſenſe and might make ſom im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Auditory. But if our Dr. ſteps into a Pulpit, and ſpeakes in the new coyn'd terms of the Reformation; <hi>I who am your Elder placed in the Synagogue by the Holy Wind, for the feeding of your Carcaſſes, do denounce vnto you in the name of our Anoynted, Baal and rayn; that if you be not regenerated by Waſhing. and prepared for the ſecret of the Table, you Shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned body and Carcaſs to the Graue, and</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:97770:97"/> 
                  <hi>your portion ſhall be with the Lord of a fly, and his Meſſengers.</hi> Would not the Auditory think, our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> raved; and in lieu of compunction, burſt out into laughter? by this you may ſee how impoſſible it is for the Reformation to convert any Pagan to Chriſtianity, or Chriſtan to piety, if they vſe their own ſenſe and language of Scripture.</p>

               <p>FRom pag. 177. to pag. 184. I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my faith thus: I belieue the miſterie of the Trinitie, becauſe God revealed it; I belieue God revealed it, becauſe the Church by which God ſpeakes, tells vs he revealed it; If you aſk why I believe God ſpeakes by the Church; I anſwer, becauſe the Church it ſelf, by which God ſpeaks, ſaies he ſpeaks by her; and I am bound
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97770:97"/> to belieue he ſpeaks hy her, as ſhee ſaies, becauſe he credits her with ſo many Miracles, which make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible he ſpeakes by her; ſee if you pleaſe this Reſolution proved at large in the place quoted: My An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt ſaies it has as many Circles, as it has words; but not one Circle does he as much as attempt to ſhew, like a Phyſitian who would tell you are dangerouſly ſick, but not mention any diſeaſe you have, nor preſcribe you any remedie: He fancies I contradict my ſelf, making Miracles ſom time the vltimat reaſon of believing the Church: and ſomtime ſaying they are not a ſufficient motive of the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of her Doctrin. But I need no more proof to convince him of a miſtake, but my Readers labour in reading the place I cited aboue, of my former Treatiſe; there I expreſly ſay, (and in nowhere any thing to the contrary) that Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles cannot be the Motive of our faith; becauſe if they be abſolutly evident, they cannot be the Motive of our faith; which of its own nature is obſcure; if they be <hi>Morally</hi> evident Miracles, they cannot be a Motive of faith, becauſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97770:98"/> its Motive muſt be infalliblie true.</p>
               <p>My D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> read in the laſt line of my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi> the word <hi>Miracle;</hi> and without any more reflexion, believed I gave Miracles for a motive of our faith: but there I diſtinguiſh two Motives, as my Reader may ſee; the firſt is, of my Act of faith, why I believe God ſpeakes by the Church; and this I ſay is nothing els, but becauſe the Church itſelf, by which God ſpeakes, tells vs that he ſpeakes by her: the ſecond Motive is of my obligation of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this truth, and my judgment of its <hi>Credibility;</hi> and this I ſay, are the Miracles wrought by the Church; for theſe make it evidently credible to vs, that God ſpeakes by her, as ſhe ſaies, and when ſuch Miracles intervene, wee are obliged to belieue God ſpeakes by her: Our Adverſarie ſaies this diſtinction of Motives, the one for <hi>our Act of faith;</hi> and the other for <hi>our Iudgment of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and obligation of believing, is but a patch to couer the incoherencie of my Doctrin, and needleſs for any thing els; for the ſame reaſon which makes me believe, makes the faith credible, and ſhews me my obligation of believing.</hi> This is prettie good Engliſh,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97770:98"/> but very bad Divinity; for before wee elicit the <hi>Act</hi> of faith, the judgment of its credibility muſt precede, and our obligation of believing muſt be made knowen to vs; the Motive therefore of this Credibilitie and obligation, is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Motive of the Act itſelf; for after that this Motive of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is aſſented vnto, and our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acknowledg'd, the Act of faith may be denied, through willfullneſs and Obſtinacy; and thus men becom Heretics: but our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> does not loue to diue into theſe ſubtilities; its to <hi>flay a flea,</hi> he ſaies.</p>
               <p>Now you ſhall ſee a new diſcovery of the Church of Romes impietie made by my Antagoniſt in my <hi>Reſolution</hi> of faith: pag. 184. I ſaid, the chief and laſt motive, wheron our faith doth reſt is the Word of God ſpeaking to vs by the Church; the Church I ſay, by which God actually ſpeakes vnto vs in this preſent age; for wee do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue becauſe God did ſpeake by the Church in the 1. 2. and 3. age, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpeakes now vnto vs by her, as he did to the primitive Chriſtians in thoſe ages. <hi>A plain confeſsion,</hi> quoth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97770:99"/> the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>of the guilt of the Church of Rome: they exclude the primitive Church of the three firſt ages, from being the Miſtreſs of our faith, and ſubſtitute the corrupt Church of this age;</hi> and heer he rattles at the Pope and Rome. For my part, I ſee no diſcouerie heer, but of his diſingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhutting his eyes that he might not ſee; for I ſay, that God ſpeakes to vs by the Church of this preſent age, as he did ſpeake to the primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians by the Church of the firſt ages; where then do I exclude the Primitive Church from being the Miſtreſs of our faith; the Church in the primitive ages was the Miſtreſs and Oracle, by which God ſpoke in thoſe ages; the Church in this preſent age is the Oracle by which he ſpeakes to vs, the Church in all ages is the ſame, and ſpeakes but the ſame; but it's not enough for vs in this age that the Church ſpoke this Doctrin, but wee muſt have the teſtimonie of the Church of this age, that this is the Doctrin that was taught by the Church in thoſe former ages, for to confound Heretics and Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who deny our Doctrin was taught in the primitive ages; and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97770:99"/> why I have ſaid, that the motive of our faith is the Word of God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the Church, not in the 1. 2. and 3. age, but in this age; for it would little auaile vs for our faith, that God ſpoke by his Church in thoſe ages, if the Church of this age did not aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vs that the Church then did ſpeake, as nowſhe does</p>
               <p>An othet ſcruple troubles our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> that I ſhould ſay wee are bound to belieue God ſpeakes by the Church, becauſe he credits her with Miracles; <hi>and vhere be thoſe Miracles,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>wrought by the Council of Trent, which make it credible to me that God ſpeakes by it?</hi> if a Council <hi>were conven'd now, to condemn Ianſeniſm, I muſt believe God ſpeakes by the Church in that Council; and are you ſure to find Miracles at hand, as ſoon as the Council is joyned?</hi> Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> rallies merrily; let vs follow his mode and help him to ſport; Do not you pretend, that your Proteſtant Doctrin delivered in this age is evidently cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible by the Miracles of the Apoſtles, and the old Teſtament? ſo you would perſwade vs pag. 56. have you any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of this age to credit it? had the Parliament Miracles at hand, cut and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97770:100"/> dry, when it framed the 39. Articles? No; you ſay your Doctrin of this age is the ſame which was taught by the Apoſtles; and its ſufficiently credited by the Miracles, you ſay, which the Apoſtles and Moyſes wrought, when they preacht it: pray D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> take the like anſwer from vs: our Doctrin delivered by the Council of Trent, of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, Purgatorie &amp;c. is the ſame which S. Bernard, Bonaventure, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, S. Auſtin, preached and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with Miracles; what obligation then has Gods Providence; or what Title has our curioſitie for to expect new Miracles for the confirmation of the ſame Doctrin? beſides D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> rhat the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the Council of Trent was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in this our age, by that great Apoſtle of the Indies S. Francis Xave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius; and confirmed by him with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Miracles; pray ſhew vs but one Miracle wrought in this, or any of the precedent ages in confirmation of yours. Three things I proued in my former Treatiſe; firſt that Miracles are vncontrolled proofs of the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Church's Doctrin; it being impoſſible rath God ſhould confirm the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97770:100"/> leaſt vntruth by a Miracle: ſecondly I related ſom Miracles related by S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin, S. Bernard, Godfredus, John Hieroſolimitanus; and believed by them to be true Miracles: thirdly I proved our obligation of believing them to have been true Miracles. Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>^'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> firſt anſwer is; <hi>Let not I. S. expect from me to beſtow my time in examining the truth of his Miracles:</hi> and ought not any man to expect it? you confeſs pag. 56. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are a moſt congruous way and a ſtrong proof of the true Church; when I alleadge therefore this congruous way and ſtrong proof for my Tenets; ought not you to beſtow your time in weakenning them, rather than in ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and railing?</p>
               <p>His ſecond anſwer is that all our Miracles are but a ſtock of <hi>Romances;</hi> I gueſt wee ſhould have this ſhort an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and therefore I did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſom Miracles, but proved convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly they were true Miracles, and that no man in his ſenſes could deny them to be ſuch; if my Antagoniſt had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the duty of a Diſputant, he ſhould have endeauored to invalid my proofs, and not be contented to tell vs they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97770:101"/> are but <hi>Romances;</hi> Can any man in his wits deny, but that S. Auguſtin, S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, S. Gregorie and many Ancient fathers of the Church had as good Wits as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall? they could therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern betwixt a Miracle and a <hi>Romance as</hi> well as he; they relate the Miracles produced by me in the <hi>Vnerring Vnerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church;</hi> they were eye witneſſes of ſom of them; they judged them to be true Miracles and recorded them in their books for ſuch: which will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Reader, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall who ſaies they were Romances: or thoſe Saints, who ſay they were Miracles? I deſired our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> that he ſhould tell vs, by what art did he and his Church come to know, thoſe Miracles were not true ones; for its ſtrange that S. Auguſtin and other Saints and learned men who lived when they were wrought, did not diſcern it; and our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> after ſo many years has found out they were but fourberies? ſure he muſt be a conjurer; but not a ſyllable does our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> anſwer; <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> they are <hi>Romances,</hi> and ther's all: I aſked would not he be eſteemed a mad man, who would ſay there was no ſuch man in the word as Julius Caeſar, of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97770:101"/> which truth wee have no other aſſurance, but the teſtimonie of Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; S. Auguſtin and our other Saints, are as credible witneſſes, I hope, as they; if therefore they tell vs they have ſeen Miracles wrought, is it not great obſtinacy in our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to deny them, and ſay they are all <hi>Romances.</hi>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97770:109"/> and ſubſtituted Cromwell; and was it not one of the chief cauſes againſt him that he was (as they apprehended) inclined to Popery?) thus you raiſe your Reformation vpon the ruin of the Popes, and fanaticiſm vpon the ruin of kings) and was it not the fear of the like effects from the ſame Principles of depoſing Princes not favorable to the Reformation, which obliged our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Stateſmen to make it a haynous crime, to ſay the king's a Papiſt or inclin'd to Popery? did all the Popes for 1600. years depoſe ſo many Princes in England, as your Reformation has in one age? or did England euer ſee in 6. ages of Popery, ſo many inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, privat conſpiracies, ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent attempts, ſuch open Rebellions againſt Regal authority, as wee have ſeen in one age of Proteſtancy? what then do you talk to vs of the power of depoſing Princes in the Pope, when wee ſee a more illimitated power aſſumed by yourſelves, and ſo frequently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed?</p>
               <p>In our Catholic Doctrin only the Pope has that power, not of depoſing Princes, but of declaring them to be

                  <hi>ipſo facto</hi> depoſed as Divins ſay; in caſe they ſhould force their ſubjects to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his error; but in our Proteſtant Principles, ther's n'ere a Proteſtant in England but has it; for wheras you all have by the principles of your Religion, the libertie of reading and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Scripture, and following with a ſafe conſcience what ſenſe of it you think to be true; if a Proteſtant judges by Scripture that Proteſtancy, as now it is profeſſed, has any mixture of Popery; if the ſpirit moves him to demand a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Church, he wants but a ſeaſonable occaſion and power for to aſk it of the king, and if he will not grant it; to oblige him by force of arms to do it: moreover this power of depoſing Princes belongs not to the Pope, as our Divins ſay, only becauſe the Prince is an Heretic, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he does not pretend to force his ſubjects to his Error; and this being ſo, certainly our Doctrin is far leſs favorable to the Pope, than to ſecular Princes, for a Pope if he becoms an heretic, tho he never ſhould endeavor to pervert others, he is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> depoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Papacy. Finally if the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97770:110"/> Popes power were ſo dangerous as our Adverſaries blow in their Proſelites eares, certainly Catholic Princes, who are as tender of their ſafetie and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as Proteſtants; would be more jealous of his ſupremacy than they are: and by the way let me advertiſe my Reader, how much our Adverſaries do injure the <hi>Frencb,</hi> in ſaying they deny this power in the Pope; its moſt fals, for tho they may pretend by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, to be exempted from that Power; but the Power they do not deny; but all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of that point are ſeverely prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97770:111"/> which this or that privat D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> gives it; the Church of England intends by that Oath to perſwade vs the Spiritual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and power of the king for to conſecrat Biſhops, give Spiritual Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, authority and power for to adminiſter the Sacraments, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe other Eccleſiaſtical functions; and that this is the ſenſe intended in the Oath by the Church of England, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears; firſt, by their Statuts and Acts of Parliament which I cited in the <hi>Introduction</hi> to this Treatiſe, which I pray reade; ſecondly by the Oath of Homage which Proteſtant Biſhops take in their Conſecration, confeſſing that <hi>they derive their Epiſcopal and Spiritual Iuriſdiction wholy and ſolely from the king.</hi> Thirdly I have proved in the Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all the Spiritual Juriſdiction, and Epiſcopal Character your Church has, is derived from Queen Elizabeth: fourthly king Henry the VIII. who was the firſt that vſurped this ſupremacy, which now you pretend; made <hi>Cromwell,</hi> a Layman, his Vicar General in <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualibus,</hi> and exerciſed that office by the authority derived from him; and king James diſpenſed with ArchBiſhop
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97770:112"/> 
                  <hi>Abbots</hi> in the Irregularity he incurred by killing a man; laſtly if by that Oath the Church of England intended only an aſſurance of our Allegiance to our king, and intended nothing prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to our faith, why would not they be content with an Oath of Allegiance worded without offence to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: and it cannot be denied but that the Church of England intended by that Oath, wee ſhould acknowledge that ſupremacie to be in the king which wee Catholics do believe to be in the Pope, and thereby denie any Spiritual Supremacy in the Pope; it alſo inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wee ſhould believe that Supremacy to be in the king, which king Henry the VIII. aſſumed to himſelf; and this was no other than that ſupremacy as wee expounded, <hi>for to Conſecrat, give power to cthers to conſecrat, inveſt</hi> and <hi>Confirm Biſhops, Adminiſter Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that ſuch a ſupremacy cannot be attributed to any ſecular Prince, is a point ſo often, ſo ſolidly, and ſo largely proved by innumerable of our Authors, and not only the texts, and examples of Primitive Princes quoted by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall in his 17. Cap. but all that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97770:112"/> the Proteſtant Writers have ſaid for themſelves in this point, ſo cleerly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and refuted, that it would be a loſs of time to me and to my Reader to anſwer my Antagoniſts little trivial objections; and repeat again what has been ſo often ſaid, and is ſo knowen even to vulgar Readers; particularly that as I have ſaid, no Proteſtant of judgment will now pretend that kind of ſupremacy in the king: Calvin ſaies they were madmen who flattered the king of England ſo far as to raiſe him to that ſupremacy; Presbiterians, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Quakers, Independents, and the reſt of your ſectaries in England and out of England vtterly diſclaim it, and will not take that Oath; and only Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics are perſecuted, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with loſs of imployments, goods and eſtates for not taking it.</p>
               <p>My Antagoniſt in his 17 Ch. brings ſom texts of S. Paul and ſom ſentences of S. Bernard, and S. Chryſoſtom to prove this ſupremacy; and whoever reades them in the places quoted by him, will plainly ſee, they only prove that wee ought to obey, and ſubmit to the heigher power and authority vnder
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97770:113"/> which wee are; and this none does or can deny; but what has that to do with our Controverſie? for thoſe paſſages quoted by my Adverſarie, do neither diſtinguiſh Powers (and my D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I hope will not be ſo ſenſeleſs, as to deny there are ſeveral powers vnder which wee are, and to all which wee are obliged to obey) nor do they determin or declare, wherin thoſe diſtinct Powers are: there is no doubt but that wee are obliged to obey all Powers vnder which wee are, beccauſe all Power is conſtituted, derived and ordained by God; but if our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> will be ſaid by S. Bernard. S. Chryſoſtom, S. Auguſtin and the ancient fathers, he will ſee in my next enſuing Chapter that the ſupream Spiritual Power, is in S. Peter and his ſucceſſors; and as he believes S. Bernard when he reprehends the disorders of the Roman Court, which he does in that 42. Epiſt. quoted by our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and in ſeveral other places, I hope he will believe him alſo when he ſaies, as wee ſhall ſee that the Pope is the ſupream Paſtor Prince and chief of all the Biſhops: and my Reader will ſee in my enſuing Chapter, how much my D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is to be blamed for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97770:113"/> his ignorance, when he ſaies in his 15. Chapt. <hi>that wee ſhall never find in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorie any mention of any claim S. Peter ſhould have of any power ouer S. Iames in Ieruſalem, S. Andrew in Achaia or any other of the Apoſtles in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Provinces, and that none of thoſe More worthy firſt Biſhops of Rome for five hundred years did pretend to any ſupremacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before wee proceed to the proof of our D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> ignorance in this point, wee muſt ſee, if this Oath of ſupremacie be needfull, and ſufficient for our ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns ſafetie; not needfull, wheras wee ſee all other Soveraigns, as well CathoIies as Proteſtants, judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecure without any ſuch Oath from their ſubjects: and when wee are ready to give to our Prince as much ſecurity of our fidelity, as any ſubjects of the world, give to their reſpective Soveraigns, why ſhould our conſciences be oppreſſed with an oath of ſupremacie repugnant to our faith; or our peace diſturbed by Remonſtrances and oaths againſt the Popes <hi>indirect Temporal Power,</hi> obtruded vpon vs by turbulent ſpirits; wheras ſuch Oaths are altogither need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for the ſecuring of ſubjects in their
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97770:114"/> Loyaltie, as will appeare by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours: wherin I would have my Reader obſerve that I do not pretend to prove that any ſuch Power is in the Pope, as I let it paſs in my former Treatiſe, ſo I do now; but I intend to prove, that tho ſuch a Power were granted to be in the Pope, neither the Oath of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, nor that Remonſtrance or Oath diſclaiming that indirect Temporal Power in the Pope aboue Princes, is needfull nor ſufficient to ſecure the ſubjects in their Obedience.</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſe there is ſuch a Power in the Pope; where leyes the danger to the Prince who has the affection of his ſubjects? in the exerciſe of that Power, you will ſay, if the Pope ſhould abſolve vs from our Allegiance, and command vs vnder pain of Excommunication not to obey him, and to ryſe in arms againſt him: but I will demonſtrat, its a caſe <hi>Morally</hi> impoſſible, and a <hi>Metaphiſical</hi> caſe, as the ſchools ſpeake, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may be obliged to obey any ſuch command or feare any ſuch Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, but may lawfully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly reſiſt, and pay their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Soveraign; for its a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97770:114"/> Principle vnanimouſly received by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Divins, that no Eccleſiaſtical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept obliges in conſcience, if in ſaid Obedience wee hazard our life, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, or our honor; for example the Church commands vs to faſt in Lent; you are ſick; you cannot faſt without a notable prejudice to your health; you are not obliged; the Church commands you to hear Maſs on ſundaies; yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without hazarding your life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are ſick; without hazarding your eſtate by reaſon of a Perſecution; you are not obliged: Now, the Pop's command and excommunication againſt our Obedience to our Prince, is but an Etcleſiaſtical Precept at moſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot oblige ſubjects with the hazard of their lyves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fortunes, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; but it is morally impoſſible but that they ſhould hazard all three, if they ſhould deny Obedience and reſiſt their Soveraign; for ſuch a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or inſurrection muſt caſt them into a warr, or a moſt evident danger of a warr, where all is expoſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's a <hi>Metaphiſical</hi> caſe and <hi>Morally</hi> impoſſible that ſubjects can be obliged by any command or cenſure of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:97770:115"/> Pope to deny obedience to their Prince: Say then what you pleaſe of that <hi>Power;</hi> many learned Diuins convincingly prove, it annoyes not the ſafetie of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the very Heterodox Soveraigns do not care for it: nor are yee who take it eſteemed better Subjects, than they who refuſe it.</p>
               <p>But you reply; tho Subjects be not <hi>obliged</hi> to obey ſuch Commands and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Pope, yet they may lawfully obey them; and ſo the Prince muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of the Subjects courteſie; for being lycenc't once by the Pope, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting to the execution but their Will and pleaſure:</p>
               <p>To this our Divins do commonly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that for to ſecure Subjects that they <hi>May not,</hi> the way is not to force vpon them an <hi>Oath</hi> diſavowing the Power in the Pope; but an <hi>Oath</hi> of never co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curring to the exerciſe of that Power, if any he had; that's to ſay, of never takeing arms, or denying Obedience to their Prince vpon any command or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Pope: which Oath, as it does not affirm or deny any Power in the Pope (let the Divins diſpute it out) ſo it rids Conſciences from Scruples of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97770:115"/> ſwearing, what they do not know to be true or fals; and ſecures them from any <hi>Fact,</hi> or exerciſe of it prejudicious to their Prince; which, and the many ſignal teſtimonies of the Loyaltie of his Catholic Subjects; and their willingneſs to give his Majeſtie any pledge of their fidelitie which does not ſhock their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, would abundantly ſatisfie our clement Prince and prudent ſtateſmen, if ſome ouer-buſy ſpirits did not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our reſt; which trouble the Iriſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did ſuffer, as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaies in his 16. Chap. not from his Majeſty, nor from his Grace his Lieutenant, (who moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly approved the ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was offered him by Perſons of knowen loyaltie, honor and learning in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference had with them, Mr Peter Walſh being preſent) but from ſom who were too too officious and vnreaſonable in preſſing Oaths vpon Catholic and Iriſh ſubjects, as if for being Catholics and Iriſh wee muſt be ſuſpected aboue all others of diſloyaltie: but ſay you again, if ſuch a <hi>Power</hi> be granted in the Pope: he may declare a Prince depoſed, and expoſe his kingdom to any forreign Prince who is pleaſed to invade it: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: if that ſhould be; how can any Oath
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97770:116"/> whatſoever of ſubjects hinder that a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince ſhall not invade our Prince? is it becauſe wee ſweare the Pope has no ſuch Power, that the forreign Prince will deſiſt from invading, if the fancie takes him? what our Divins pretend, is to ſhew, that the Oath of ſupremacie is needleſs to ſecure Subjects in their Loyaltie.</p>
               <p>Now I will ſhew that as that Oath of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is needleſs, ſo it is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſecure Subjects in their Loyaltie; and this I will ſhew in the Principles and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall: Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> has made a Solemn Vow or Oath of Povertie obliging himſelf never to have any Rents or revenews; alſo a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow of never pretending or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting any Eccleſiaſticall Dignitie; he made other Vows of Chaſtitie, Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp;c. Now he ſaies, thoſe Vows or Oaths do not oblige him: and why? becauſe ſaies he pag. 181. againſt N. N. <hi>I made a former Vow of Religious Obedience in my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to God; if I find the later Vow made to the Pope, not to conſiſt with the compliance of the former made to God, then I muſt ſtand to the former made to God, and reſcind the later made to the Pope.</hi> And juſt ſo may any Proteſtant, or Child of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſay, after taking the Oath of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97770:116"/> ſupremacy: for as wee proved in our 12. Chapt. their Rule of faith being Scripture <hi>as each Perſon of ſound judgment vnderſtands it;</hi> after ſwearing the Oath of Supremacy, if you reade and ſtudie the Scripture, and the Spirit, or your ignorance moves you to vnderſtand by the text, that the Rites, Ceremonies and practices of the Proteſtant Church are degenerated into Popery,) as Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterians, Anabaptiſts, and Quakers judge) and you paſs further, and meet ſom texts as Zuinglius, Calvin, Parſon Peeters, and Beza did, and interpret them, that you ought to demand a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of thoſe abuſes, and in caſe of a repuls, to raiſe arms againſt the king and force him to it; then you will ſay that in your Baptiſm you made a vow of Obedience and Religion to God, according his Word; that your Oath of ſupremacy does not conſiſt with the compliance of this former; and that you muſt reſcind the later and ſtand to the former; what then does your Oath of ſupremacy ſignifie in the Proteſtant Religion?</p>
               <p>Laſtly this Oath is not advantagious, but deſtructive to the Government; for
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97770:117"/> it being made the <hi>diſtinctive ſign</hi> of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and none being admitted to the king's Service in Civil or military im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, but ſuch as will take it; his Majeſtie is deprived of many ſtout and gallant ſubjects who are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſerve him, becauſe they will not ſtrain their Conſciences with an Oath: And beſides the offices of truſt in the kingdom being open to thoſe who are ready to take an oath, and there being men in all times and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths who wil never ſtick to take an oath, for to advance their fortune; the places of truſt will com to the hands of thoſe proſtituted conſciences; who, as they ſold their faith for their intereſt, will betray their truſt and king when any good bargain preſents: and who does not ſee how deſtructive this is to the government? Innumerable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences ſhew vs, particularly ſince the year 40. who were the more faithfull to the king; the Catholics who refuſed the Oath, but never drew ſword againſt him; or the Proteſtants who freely tooke it, and fought againſt him.</p>

               <p>He purſues his invective againſt the Pop's ſupremacie and tells vs <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> deteſted and diſclaimed the Title of <hi>Vniverſall Biſhop,</hi> which he ſaies, is a commendation of his Modeſtie, and a check of the vnlimited ambition of the Popes of Rome. Its true S. Gregorie, lib. 4. Epiſt. 32. 34. 36. and 38. writes againſt that name of <hi>Vniverſall Biſhop,</hi> but not in his 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> book, 60. and 67. Epiſt. as my
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97770:118"/> Adverſarie cites, for that book has but 57. Epiſtles; and what S. Gregorie condemns is not the name, but the ſenſe and meaning, in which John that ambitious Patriarck of Conſtantinople vſurped it: for it may have two mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; the one is, the Chief and firſt Biſhop, ſupream in Power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, Chief Governor of the Church; in this ſenſe S. Gregorie did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it: the ſecond meaning of that name is, to be the Univerſal Biſhop of the Church, that's to ſay the only Biſhop of the Church; ſo as that the reſt of the Biſhops are not properly Biſhops, but adminiſtrators or Vicars vnder him: In this ſenſe did <hi>Iohn</hi> the Patriark of Conſtantinople aſſume that name, and S. Gregorie did check his ambition, as appears in his 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> book Epiſt. 71. <hi>Hoc in totius Eccleſiae injuriam &amp; omnium, &amp;c. In this he injures the whole Church, and deſpiſes you all, for if one be the Vniverſal Biſhop, as he vnderſtands it, then none of you all is a Biſhop.</hi> Again l. 4. Epiſt 38. <hi>Deſpectis fratribus, appetit ſolus Epiſcopus vocari: Deſpiſing his Brethren he ambitions to be called the only Biſhop.</hi> You know very well D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> that the Pope does
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97770:119"/> not pretend to be called, and that wee do not call him Univerſal Biſhop in this ſenſe, as if he did pretend to be, or wee ſhould be ſo ſenſeleſs as to ſay, he is the only Biſhop in the Church; and the reſt of the Biſhops are not truly and properly Biſhops.</p>
               <p>But in the ſenſe that the Pope aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes that name, that's to ſay to be the chief Biſhop in power and Juriſdiction aboue the reſt, the ſupream Governor of the Church, S Gregorie did never blame, nor condemn it; nay l. 7. Epiſt. 65. ſpeaking of the Sea of Rome he ſaies, <hi>In ſaying he is ſubject to the Sea of Rome, I know no Bishop but is ſubject to it,</hi> and S. Leo Epiſt. 48. calls the Chair of Peter, <hi>the Seate of the Vniverſal Church;</hi> and S. Gregorie l. 4. Epiſt. 32. ſaies, and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall confeſſes, that the name of Univerſal Biſhop was offered by the Council of Chalcedon Act. 3. and Act. 16. to Leo Pope; this was one of the four firſt General Councils, which our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> reveres for a Holy and ſacred Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and muſt conſequently confeſs, that that name of Univerſal Biſhop, which it offered to Leo, was Orthodox and lawfull; or that the Concil erred
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:97770:119"/> foully and irreligiouſly in offering it: Its true as S Gregorie ſaies. The Popes before him did not aſſume, but refuſe and deteſt that name, but that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was an odious name, by reaſon of the ſenſe in which John the Patriark, and others did aſſume it; therefore they would not vſe it: not becauſe it was not juſt and lawfull in the true ſenſe meaned by the Church.</p>
               <p>And if wee can prove that S. Peter was the chief in power and authoritie aboue the Apoſtles, the ſupream in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; ther's no difficultie in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that his Succeſſors are the chief and ſupream in Power and Authority aboue the other Biſhops. Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaies pag. 31. he does not read that Peter ſhould have any Authority aboue An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew in Achaia, or Thomas in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or the other Apoſtles in their reſpective Provinces and this proves no more, but that either his Librarie is ill furniſht with books, or that he does not ſtudie, nay nor reade carefully the Bible: of all the Texts it affords, I will produce but three with the gloſſes of ſom fathers vpon them.</p>
               <p>In two ſeveral occaſions, Chriſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:97770:120"/> ſpeakes particularly of the power he was to give the Apoſtles for to tye and vntye: the firſt, Math 16. he ſpeakes to Peter alone, <hi>tibi dabo claves regni caelorum, quodcunque ligaveris ſuper terram, erit ligatum &amp; in caelis, quodcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſolveris ſuper terram, erit ſolutum &amp; in caelis. To thee I will give the keyes of the Kingdom of the Heavens; whatſoever you ſhall bind on earth ſhall be bound in the Heavens; whatſoever you ſhall vnbind on earth ſhall be vnbound in the Heavens.</hi> Again ſpeaking of this power he was to give to his Apoſtles, Math. 18. he ſaies, <hi>whatever yee ſhall bind on earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatever yee ſhall bind on earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatever yee ſhall vnbind on earth, ſhall be vnbound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> Origen Hom. 6. in Math. obſerves the great difference expreſſed in this text betwixt Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles. <hi>Non modica differentia eſt, quod Petro datae ſunt claves non vnius caeli, ſed multorum cae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>I propoſed a ſyllogiſm in my former Treatiſe pag. 188. for our Tenet of Tranſubſtantiation, grounded vpon the text of S. Luke 22. <hi>Take eat this is my body which is given for you:</hi> the text denotes, he gave to them ſomwhat to eate; I proved it was his reall Body; for; He gave <hi>to</hi> them to eate, what he gave <hi>for</hi> them; the Text ſaies it, <hi>take eat this is my body which is given for you;</hi> but he gave <hi>for</hi> them his real body; therefore he gave <hi>to</hi> them his Real bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for as I advertis'd, the Text makes no difference betwixt what he gave <hi>To</hi> them, and what he gave <hi>for</hi> them: by what principles then muſt we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the text, and ſay that what he gave <hi>to</hi> them was a figure only, and what he gave for them was his Real
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:97770:125"/> body? will it not be as lawfull to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> to interpret the text as to you, and ſay that as the text in the firſt part im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports only a figurative body given <hi>to</hi> them; ſo in the ſecond part it imports but a figurative body given <hi>for</hi> them.</p>
               <p>His anſwer is that my argument <hi>is not worth a ruſh; that with a peece of his Logic he will prove it a paralogiſm;</hi> and raiſes ſuch a thick miſt of ſcholaſtical terms ſo often repeated in few lynes, that I defy you read his diſcours and your head not to ake: after a great deal of tittle tattle againſt the <hi>form</hi> of my ſyllogiſm; the vpſhot of his anſwer is, that tho the text does not diſtinguiſh betwixt what Chriſt gave <hi>To</hi> vs in the ſupper, and what he gave <hi>for</hi> vs yet our eyes do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh betwixt both, for we ſee what he gave to vs, was but <hi>Bread,</hi> and what he gave for vs on the Croſs was an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic Body. This anſwer I did forſee and replied againſt it in my former Treatiſe; but not a ſyllable does my Antagoniſt anſwer againſt my replies, as if I had made none.</p>
               <p>But its well he has attempted to ſay ſomwhat; he confeſſes plainly the text makes no difference betwixt what
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97770:126"/> he gave to his diſciples in the ſupper and what he was to give for them vpon the croſs; our eyes he ſaies diſtinguiſh betwixt both; becauſe they did ſee but bread in the ſupper; and they did ſee an Organic body, vpon the croſs. Very well: I pray D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, the night that Chriſt was at the ſupper, when he took the bread and vttered thoſe words, <hi>take eat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is my Body which is given for you.</hi> Did the Apoſtles ſee with their eyes that night Chriſt's <hi>Organic Body</hi> given for vs vpon the croſs! No, for he was not then cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: What did they believe then, that Chriſt would give <hi>To</hi> them to eate? the figure only of his Body ſaies our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, real bread; becauſe their eyes did ſee but bread: and what did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve then, that Chriſt would give <hi>for</hi> them on the croſs? an <hi>Organic Body</hi> ſaies he; why ſo? for the text as you confeſs, makes no diſtinction betwixt what he gave <hi>To</hi> them, and <hi>For</hi> them; our eyes you ſay make the diſtinction; then, in the night of the ſupper their eyes did not ſee his Organic Body on the croſs; how could they therefore diſtinguiſh then, what he gave <hi>to</hi> them to eate, from that he was to give <hi>for</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:97770:126"/> them on the croſs; O but ſay you, the next day after they did ſee his Organic Body <hi>for</hi> them vpon the croſs: its true; but I ſpeake of the ſupper the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; then, as they believed that Chriſt's Body was given <hi>To</hi> them, becauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>take eat</hi> ſo they believed at the ſame time his body would be given <hi>for</hi> them on the croſs, becauſe he ſaid in the ſame text, which is given <hi>for</hi> you; and my difficultie is, ſince they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the bodie given <hi>to</hi> them, was only a figurative body, by what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple did they diſtinguiſh that the body which would be given for them was an Organic Body? for by virtue of the text, as you confeſs, they could not Diſtinguiſh there two different bodies; nor by their eyes, becauſe they did not ſee the Organic Body on the croſs.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of Abraham, Iſaac, and the ancient Patriarks; they believed that Chriſt would give his Body <hi>to</hi> vs in the ſupper, and <hi>for</hi> vs on the croſs; doubtleſs theſe Miſteries were revealed to them: did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was a figurative only body was given <hi>to</hi> vs in the ſupper, and an Organic real body on the croſs? by
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97770:127"/> what principle did they make this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of what was given <hi>To</hi> vs, from what was given <hi>for</hi> vs? not by any text or ſupernatural revelation; for ſure you will not ſay he ſpoke to them of the Ancient law in more expreſs and emphatic terms, than to thoſe of the law of Grace; nor by their eyes or ſenſes, for they did not ſee Chriſt in the ſupper, nor on the croſs: you muſt conclude then, that either they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his figurative only Body was to be in the ſupper and on the croſs; or that his true real and ſubſtantial Body was to be in both.</p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97770:129"/> ſenſe which did ſee nothing but a man; he believed him to be a Spirit: ſo alſo tho our eyes ſee nothing but bread in the conſecrated Hoſt, yet we believe againſt the evidence of ſenſe, that it is no bread but the Body of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> is of a more infallible aſſurance than our eyes and other ſenſes.</p>
               <p>But ſaies our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> this Miſterie is quite repugnant to human reaſon; becauſe thence it would follow, that Chriſt's Bodie would be at one time in as many different places, as there are conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hoſts; and reaſon ſhews a Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at one time, but in one place. If he had read carefully S. Paul's l. Epiſtle to the Corint. chap 15. this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie would not have ſtartl'd him: there the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes two kind of Bodies (or rather one and the ſame body in two different ſtates and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) a ſpiritual, and an earthly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, which two bodies are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially different, or two different ſubſtances, but one and the ſame body vnder different qualities and accidents; for he ſaies, this our naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Body ſhall be changed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97770:129"/> of the dead; into a ſpiritual body that's to ſay purified from earthly qualities; it ſhall be ſpiritualiſed, and becom immortal, impaſſible and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſpiritual qualities.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97770:130"/> no leſs repugnant to reaſon, and to the exigence of a natural earthly Maſſive Body, than to be in many places; and how did that happen? S. Epiph anſwers Haer. 64. <hi>Our Saviour riſed from the dead, not taking an other body, but the ſelf ſame body, which he had, changing it into a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſubtilitie, or ſpiritualizing it, by which he entred the door being ſhut. He who entred,</hi> ſaies S. Ambroſe l. 10. c. 24 in Luc. <hi>had a true real body; how then did he enter the door being ſhut? by the qualities of a ſpirit which he received in his Reſurrection; the body is ſowen a natural, corruptible, earthly body; it riſeth a ſpiritual, heavenly incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible one.</hi> By theſe Principles of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſent of ancient Fathers, we can alſo vnderſtand, that tho theſe our natural, earthly corruptible bodies, cannot be at one time in many places; yet glorious bodies, being ſpiritualized, by virtue of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual endowments, may be in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as ſpiritual ſubſtances are.</p>
               <p>An other repugnance againſt reaſon our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> pretends in this miſterie, that the accidents of bread would exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſubſtance to ſupport them: yet we have ſeveral examples in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>It's time we examin our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>^'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> anſwer to my ſecond ſyllogiſm: he ſaies he can reckon as many vices in it as in my firſt; but what was expected was, not to tell vs what he could do, but to point out thoſe vices: it was vpon that paſſage of John, 6. when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>my fleſh is truly meate my blood is truly</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:97770:131"/> 
                  <hi>drink;</hi> the Jewes repleyed, <hi>this ſaying is hard, how can this man give vs his fleſh to be eaten:</hi> I propoſed two ſyllogiſms, the firſt was thus; The Jews thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible what Chriſt affirmed; but what the Jews thought to be impoſſible, was that he ſhould give his true fleſh to be eaten; for no man ever yet apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any impoſſibilitie in giuing the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of his body to be eaten; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Iews, who eat yeerly the Paſchal lamb, which they believed to be the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt; therefore what Chriſt affirmed, was that he would give his true and real fleſh. My Adverſarie very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily lets this ſyllogiſm paſs in ſylence. And any man would think its a pinching argument.</p>
               <p>My ſecond ſyllogiſm vpon that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was; A damnable vnbeliever is he who denies a Truth, ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to him to be revealed; for tho a man may be an Vnbeliever for denying a Truth, but not a <hi>Damnable one,</hi> if it be not ſufficiently propoſed to him to be revealed: but the Jews in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are called damnable vnbelievers, and what they denied, was a real fleſhy eating of Chriſts fleſh, as Catholics be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:97770:131"/> it: therefore Chriſt ſufficiently propoſed a real fleſhy eating of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as we believe it: My Adverſarie quarrels with the <hi>Minor</hi> of the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which he conceits to be a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm becauſe he ſaies its compoſed of two different propoſitions: but this is but a poor ſhift to divert his Reader, and draw breath; for the ſenſe of the Minor appears to any half eyed man to be this, <hi>The Iews were called damnable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, becauſe they denyed the fleſhy eating of Chriſts body:</hi> what ſaie you to this Propoſition D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>? He denies it, and this is the whole and ſole anſwer we have from our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> a naked denial, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any textor reaſon, why; but tells vs they were called <hi>damnable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers not for denying the fleſhy eating of his Body, but becauſe they miſunderſtood Chriſt, and did not vnderſtand that he ſpoke only of his figurative fleſh.</hi> But the <hi>non</hi> ſenſe of this anſwer is threefold; firſt for to be a damnable vnbeliever it's neceſſarie to deny a <hi>truth,</hi> as our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, and as all rhe world muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; but the Jews did not deny the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Preſence,</hi> for our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> himſelf, both in his printed ſermon and in his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97770:132"/> Book, pag. 115. ſaies that they did not aprehend that Chriſt at all ſpoke of his figurative Preſence, but of his reall fleſhy Preſence; and how could they deny or affirm, what they did not as much as dream was ſpoken of? ſecondly to be a <hi>Damnable</hi> vnbeliever, The truth muſt be ſufficiently propoſed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers; and our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> himſelf acknowledges that nothing of a figurative Preſence was ſufficiently propoſed to them; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he acknowledges, that they did not apprehend that Chriſt ſhould have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his figurative Preſence, but of a real fleſhy eating of his body; Chriſt's meaning therefore was not ſufficiently declared vnto them; how could they therefore be damnable vnbelievers: thirdly he ſaies <hi>They did miſaprehend Chriſt's Words, and did not vnderſtand him to have ſpoken of his figurative Preſence.</hi> And is it therefore they muſt be called dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vnbelievers, becauſe they did not vnderſtand what Chriſt ſaid? will you call your Auditorie damn'd Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics becauſe they do not vnderſtand you when you preach? to call a man a Dolt or a dull headed fellow, becauſe he does not vnderſtand, may paſs; but
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97770:132"/> we are all in a ſad condition, if we muſt be called damnable vnbelievers becauſe wee do not vnderſtand a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher or Teacher: I pray Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this diſcours, the Jews are called vnbelievers; therefore they muſt have denied ſom revealed Truths, but they denied no other but the real fleſhy ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt's body, for the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaies, they vnderſtood Chriſt did ſpeak of that, and of nothing els; therefore they are damnable vnbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers for denying the fleſhy eating of Chriſts body.</p>
               <p>For to prove that Chriſt ſpoke of the figure of his fleſh, our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> brings not a ſyllable of Scripture but that text which he cited in his Sermon and I anſwered in my former Treatiſe <hi>The fleſh profiteth nothing, it's the Spirit that quickneth; my Words are Spirit and life.</hi> He ſaies Chriſt gave them to vnderſtand by theſe words, that he was to give them a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of his Body, and that it was a check for vnderſtanding him to have ſpoken of his true and real fleſh: and if you will not believe this vpon his bare word, you may chooſe, for he will give you no other ptoof: But that you may

Paul ſaid Rom. 1. 22. that the inviſible God being knowen by the Viſible creatures which are made, <hi>They changed the glorie of the immortal God into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four footed beaſts, they changed the truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped and ſerved the Creatures more than the Creatour.</hi> Their Idolatrie did conſiſt in that they adored theſe Creatures, Gold, ſylver, birds, four footed beaſts &amp;c. not as Gods, for the wiſer Heathens were not ſo ſenſeleſs as to believe they were Gods; nor as Images of one, true, inviſible God, as Chriſtians believe, for you ſhall not

Gent. l. 6. where you may reade the anſwer of the Heathen Philoſophers to Arnobius checking them for adoring ſtocks and ſtones: <hi>You err, ſay they, O Arnobius in what you affirm; for wee do not think the matter of braſs, ſylver, and gold to be God and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deities of themſelves: No wee are wiſer than ſo; but we honour and worſhip the Gods or Deities in thoſe ſacred Statues, whom the Virtue of ſacred Dedication hath brought into them, and made to dwell in thoſe Images made by Art:</hi> You ſee Reader, what the Heathens adored; they adored the Images not for themſelves or any Deitie they ſhould have of themſelves; but for the <hi>Gods</hi> or <hi>Deities,</hi> which by <hi>Sacred Dedication</hi> were brought to lodge in them; and S.

                  <hi>ADORATION, AND INVOCATION OF Saints, no Idolatry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OUr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> often charges vs with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie</hi> for our Adoration of the Conſecrated Hoſt, for our Adoration of Images, and for our Adoration of Saints: to the two firſt parts of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation we have anſwered; it remains we prove the Adoration of Saints to be no crime: and I cannot better prove it than by a Text which our Adverſaries frequently bring for to prove the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs of this practice: when the Angel Revel. 19. appeared to S. John, the Apoſtle fell flat on the ground for to adore him; the Angel forbid him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was his fellow ſervant: if the Adoration of an Angel or Saint be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie; therefore the Apoſtle was an Jdolater; nay which is wors, a relaps Jdolater; for again he fell on the ground to adore the Angel ch. 22. and the Angel prohibited him the ſecond
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97770:157"/> time: hence its manifeſt, that either the Apoſtle fell twice into Jdolatrie or that adoration of Angels, and Saints is none: but ſay you why did the Angel forbid him? J anſwer, out of his reſpect to Human nature, ſince his Lord and king had aſſumed it: this reaſon S. Greg. gives, Hom. 8. in Evang. <hi>Ante Redemptor is adventum, Angeli adorantur &amp; iacent; &amp; poſtmodum adorari refugiunt; quod naturam noſtram quàm prius deſpexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, poſtquam illam ſupra ſe aſſumptam conſpiciunt, proſtratam ſibi videre perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſcunt. Before the coming of Chriſt, the Angels received adoration from men; but after he took our Nature, they would not ſee proſtrated before them, that Nature which was exalted aboue them.</hi> Or if this reaſon does not pleaſe you; its ſufficient to my purpoſe to prove, he did not prohibit it becauſe it was Jdolatrie; for if you ſay the Angel did judge it to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, I ſay the Apoſtle did judge it was not; and in our inſtruction for God's Worship and Religion, wee are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Apoſtle, rather than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel according the advice of S. Paul Gal. 1. 8. <hi>tho an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach vn to you an other Ghoſpel, than that</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:97770:157"/> 
                  <hi>which we have preached, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Invocation of Saints I have proved in the <hi>Vnerring Vnerrable Church</hi> by ſeveral Paſſages of Scripture, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that Saints departed from this life know our affaires on earth, that they pray for vs; that many have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived favours and bleſſings by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion: I pray Reader read my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe there, and ſpare me the labour of repeating it; and you will admire the courage of my Adverſarie who complains, as if he had juſtice and reaſon on his ſyde, that I do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his arguments vpon this ſubject; and not one argument does he bring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Sermon, or book, but that text of S. Peter Act. 4. <hi>that there is no ſalvation in any other but Ieſus Chriſt; nor any other name vnder Heaven given among men whereby wee may be ſaued:</hi> where he concludes, we cannot aſk the mediation of Saints, without robbing Chriſt of his prerogative of Mediatorſhip. Jt's not pardonable in him to repeat again, what has been ſo cleerly anſwered, as my Reader may ſee in my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſe: in hopes we may never any more
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:97770:158"/> hear of this thred bare ſtorie, let him take this ſyllogiſm: <hi>We</hi> believe the Vnity of Chriſt's Deyty, as much as the Vnitie of his Mediatorſhip: but its not againſt our belief of his Deitie, to call the Saints, as well of Heaven, as of earth Gods; for David calls all Juſt men Gods: <hi>I ſay yee are all Gods, and the ſons of the heigheſt all,</hi> therefore its not againſt our belief of his Mediatorſhip, that wee ſhould call the Saints, as well in heaven, as on earth, our Mediators: and who does not ſee the weakneſs of our D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> diſcourſe; for if becauſe Chriſt is our only Mediator, we muſt not aſk the prayers of the Saints in heaven; neither muſt we aſk any Mediator on earth, which is evidently againſt the practice of all congregations; for we aſk one an other to pray for vs: <hi>But how come this argument to prove,</hi> (ſaies our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>) <hi>as I. S. pretends, that we muſt not aſk the prayers of the Saints on earth.</hi> Did ever Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician make the like Quere? do not you pretend by the text, that Chriſt is our <hi>onely</hi> Mediator becauſe there is no other name vnder Heauen (thats to ſay on earth) where by we may be ſaued? if therefore the text proves any thing
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:97770:158"/> againſt the mediation of Saints, it proves againſt the mediation of the Saints <hi>vnder</hi> heaven, that's to ſay on earth. We acknowledge, as I have ſaid in my former Treatiſe, Chriſt to be our onely Mediator by <hi>Redemption,</hi> becauſe he alone did, and was able by his death to reconcile vs to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem vs; but he is not our only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator by <hi>interceſſion,</hi> becauſe others pray for vs; tho he in a far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent degree.</p>
               <p>He perceived it ſeems the weakneſs of this charge, and quits it; and runs all along vpon an other point, proving our exceſs in our devotion and worſhip of Saints; and all he brings to prove it, is reduced to three heads, and all three have not one dram of brains; the firſt is his Prudence, that for ought we know many of thoſe we eſteem Saints, are wicked and damn'd wretchs; therefore we muſt not pray to any Saint: I hope he does not meane the B. Virgin, nor the Apoſtles, nor S. Auguſtin, S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, and ſuch others; let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give vs leaue to pray to them; and let him point out what Saint is he, of thoſe whom we worſhip, of whoſe San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:97770:159"/> we have not as much aſſurance; as we have of S. Auguſtin and S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom; and then we will not worſhip them: but to ſay we muſt pray to none: becauſe ſom reputed Saints are not ſuch; is as much as if you did ſay, we muſt not eſteem and honor any men on earth for their great Virtue and learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſom reputed to be Virtuous and learned, are but Hypocrits and Idiots. The ſecond exceſs is that we build more Churches to Saints than to God; and he will not take our anſwer, that what Churchs we build to the Saints, we build them to God, becauſe its for his ſake we honor the Saints: for ſaies he, <hi>if a king did conſtitut his Son Sollicitor general for his Subjects, it would not be well taken by the king, that the Subjects ſhould make their application to the Servants in Court, neglecting their application to the Prince:</hi> but D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> what if the king were diſpoſed to honor, not only his ſon, but alſo the Servants at Court for his Son's ſake (if any man ſerves me, my father will honor him Jo. 12.) if he decreed to grant whatever his ſon would aſk, for his Subjects, and not only what himſelf would aſk, but what
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:97770:159"/> any of the Servants in Court would aſk in his name: certainly the power of the ſon would be the greater.</p>
               <p>The third exceſs is, that we call the B. Virgin our <hi>Savioureſs,</hi> our <hi>Redeemereſs;</hi> deſperat expreſſions he ſaies, againſt the text of S. Peter which ſayes, there is no name vnder heaven whereby we can be ſaved, but that of Jeſus Chriſt: Theſe indeed are deſperat expreſſions in the meaning you take them, but not in the meaning our Church gives them: if you go to the Dictionarie, or the Grammer to looke for the ſenſe of thoſe words, you may render our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin and practice ridicule; but if you go to the Church, and be inform'd in what ſenſe ſhe takes them, you will find they are religious: God calls Moyſes the <hi>God of Pharao;</hi> if you take the word in its proper and vſual ſignification, its a blaſphemy, wherof I hope you will not accuſe God: David calls the Juſt, <hi>Gods and the Sons of the Heigheſt;</hi> a deſperat expreſſion if you take the words in their gramatical ſenſe, but religious, if you take them in David's meaning: The great Baptiſt was not the <hi>Light,</hi> but a <hi>witneſs of the Light,</hi> ſaies the Evangeliſt;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:97770:160"/> Chriſt was <hi>the true Light for to illuminat the world;</hi> yet Chriſt himſelf calls his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>the light of the world;</hi> is this a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat expreſſion? Chriſt is the only foundation of the Church, ſaies S. Paul, yet in Revel: c. 21. wee read the twelve Apoſtles are the twelve foundations of the Cittie of God: you will not ſtick to ſay Chriſt is the only Mediator and reconciliator of Man with God, as S. Paul ſayes; and yet Wisd. c. 4. <hi>Noe</hi> is called not only <hi>Reconciliator,</hi> but the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> betwixt God and man: And you muſt acknowledge theſe expreſſions are not deſperat in the ſenſe and meaning of thoſe who vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them, tho in a gramatical ſenſe they may be: ſo you muſt confeſs the expreſſion of <hi>Savioureſs, Redeemereſs</hi> &amp;c. are Catholic and Religious in the ſenſe of the Church, which is not any other, but that the B. Virgin is the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument after Chriſt for our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Do we call her <hi>Redeemereſs?</hi> wee ſpeake with S. Cyril, Hom. cont.

No, hee'l not heare ſpeake of a Purgatorie; he is reſolu'd not to ſtop or ſtand in the road; if God will not haue Heauen's gates open for him at his departure from this life, hee'l take vp his lodging in hell. <hi>Let not I.

No D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, you have miſtaken the point; The point is, why you forſook the Catholic Church and became a Proteſtant? you ſay, for our Errors, wherof Purgatorie is one; you vndertook in your Sermon to prove theſe Errors by plain and cleer Scripture: <hi>let me keep you to the point</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>; let vs ſee your cleer and plain texts denying Purgatorie: you whoſe Rule of faith is <hi>Scripture alone,</hi> which, you ſay, cleerely ſhewes our Errors; you are to be demanded cleer and plain texts to prove ther's no Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but we are not to be challeng'd to produce convincing texts, becauſe our

               <p>You have quite ſweru'd from the point D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, the point was to ſhew by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing texts, that there is no other receptacle of ſoules in the other world but <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> of the damned, as you ſay, grounded vpon that text, <hi>where the Tree falls there it ſhall remain:</hi> for I proved convincingly there is an other place, by S. Peter 1.

(ſure it was not the damn'd ſoules he releaſed) why did not you anſwer to this text D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>? you clapt it vnder deck, becauſe it was the Point, and it you reſolved not to touch.

               <p>And tho, as I ſaid, wee had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing text for this, or our other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; our Doctrin ſtands vnſhaken vpon the teſtimonie of our Church, and vpon the vnanimous conſent of precedent ages: wee are in poſſeſſion of this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin theſe 1600. yeares; our long poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſufficiently credits our Doctrin; you are Aggreſſors, you muſt bring evident proofs againſt vs; as Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; its our duty but to anſwer to your allegations: But my D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> replies, that they are Defendants of their libertie; that we are Actors who inuade their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and impoſe vpon them Doctrins which are not in the Word of God: yee <hi>Defendants,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and not Actors? who were born but yeſterday, who puſht vs out of our Churchs and eſtates for our Doctrin: you ſay we inuade your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie can you have any libertie for not believing a Doctrin wherof the world was poſſeſſed for ſo many ages?

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:97770:165"/> vpon vs the belief of two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a figurative preſence, &amp;c. never yet knowen in the Orthodox Church, and we muſt ſtand for our Libertie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you produce Gods Word to prove it: but the Ancient poſſeſſion of our Doctrin is ſufficient to maintain vs in it; and you can have no libertie for to deny it, vntill you prove the poſſeſſion to be injuſt: you ſay our poſſeſſion may by queſtion'd, and if we do not prove our, Title our poſſeſſion will be forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And if we ſhould forfeit our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, I would gladly know, what are Proteſtants the neerer to prove theirs to be the true Church or Doctrin? The Arrians and Pelagians will have as good a claim to it as you: But D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> we have allready proved our Title: we were once put in poſſeſſion of the true Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin by Chriſt: this is our Title, and this you confeſs becauſe you ſay we were once the true Church: now its your dutie to prove we fell from that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, and vntill you prove this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently our Poſſeſſion is juſt, and our Doctrin muſt be believed.</p>
               <p>You are much pleaſed with that Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical ſubtilitie, that prayers for the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:97770:165"/> dead (which you allow to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable) may be made for other ends, than for to draw Soules out of the fire of Purgatorie; becauſe ſay you, that God forſeeing the prayers which in future times will be made for perſons decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as he is infinitly liberal and good, may anticipat the reward of thoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, to the benefit of the Perſons prayed for; by giuing them a good death; And our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> according his old mode ſaies not a word of my anſwer to this diſcourſe, which my Reader, if he reads my former Treatiſe, will find to be ſatisfactorie and ſolid; it would be tedious to repeate it: but let me aſk one queſtion of my Adverſarie: does he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly believe, that the Jews knew this ſchool ſubtilitie? they praied for the dead, as I have proved, and certainly they knew not that quillet; but their practice was regulated by their beliefe, that ſoules depart from this life often times with ſins, which muſt be expiated in the other world, which the very Text ſignifies <hi>vt a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97770:166"/> ſubtilitie of ſom few Modern Divins, which probably may be fals. I do not ſee what this ſchool ſubtility may be good for, but for to comfort our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>^'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in a ſcruple which he ought to have; for ifhe believes ther's no Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory from whence ſouls may be releaſed, then he is obliged in conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to reſtore all the monies he received why lſt he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Catholic Church, for to pray for ſouls in Purgatory and their releaſe from thence; for, his being of a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that there was a purgatorie when he received the monies, does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him now from the obligation of reſtitution, ſince he is convinced ther's none; but I do fear our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> will not be ſoon perſwaded to reſtore that monie; probably he will tell vs the Perſons he prayed for, got a good death by his Prayers.</p>
               <p>But to ſtrick the nail in the head, we will prove that Prayers for the dead have been practiſed by the Church and Ancient Fathers directly for this end, to draw Soules our of the ſire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: S.

               <p>From Purgatorie he coms to attack our Tenet of Indulgences; and that you may ſee with how little juſtice, I will declare briefly our Doctrin in this point: firſt it's an vnqueſtionable Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that any one, of the many penal works performed by Chriſt, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Redemption of this, and many other worlds, one drop of his blood was of infinit merit; whence it appears, that by the great heape of ſatisfactorie and penal works, which he exerciſed in this world, he exhibited an infinitly greater ſatisfaction for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption than was needfull: alſo it's apparent, that the many penal works of the B. Virgin, of the Apoſtles and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97770:168"/> innumerable other Saints, were a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfaction for their ſins and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, than was needfull to expiat them and ſatisfie Gods juſtice; and this we learn by <hi>Iob's</hi> words c. 6 v. 2. <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O! that my ſins for which I deſerved anger and the calamitie which I ſuffer, were weighed in a balance; as the ſands of the Sea, this</hi> (my calamitie) <hi>would appear greater.</hi> Of theſe ſuperabundant ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of Chriſt and Saints workes, wee ſay there is a treaſure in the Church; for certainly thoſe works, though need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for the <hi>Workers,</hi> are not without value and eſteem in Gods ſight; and are not fruitleſs to the Church; for that Article of our Creed, <hi>the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints,</hi> imports that the faithfull do partake, and benefit by the good works one of an other; <hi>Particeps ego ſum timentium te, &amp; cuſtodientium mandata tua,</hi> ſaies the Prophet David Pſ. 118. <hi>I am a partaker of the works of thoſe who feare you, and keep your Commandments;</hi> and ſo we muſt ſay, that thoſe ſuperabundant ſatisfactorie penal works of Chriſt and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97770:168"/> his Saints, are a treaſure of the Church, wherof the faithfull do partake: And thus we expound how they partake of it: Tho the ſin, whether Mortal or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, be remitted by Confeſſion, or Contrition; yet a temporal puniſhment remains due of the ſinner to Gods Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which I proved by Scripture and reaſon in my former Treatiſe, for the Penitent muſt not only ſatisfie the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance enjoyned by the Confeſſor, but we are exhorted to other penal works and pennances for to ſatisfie for our ſins: and therefore by the Ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, great and ſevere penances were impoſed, according the qualitie of the ſin; ſom of ſeaven years pennance; others of more; others of leſs: theſe penal works the Penitents muſt perform; or ſom other muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them for him, if he be not in a capacitie to do it; becauſe Gods juſtice muſt be ſatisfied, who as he mercifully remits the eternal pains due for our ſins, by virtue of the Sacraments, ſo he requires a temporal puniſhment for to ſatisfie his juſtice: This ſatisfaction may be made either by the Penitent himſelf, by exerciſing as much penal
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:97770:169"/> works in this life, or ſuffering in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, as much as is due of him for to ſatisfie Gods juſtice; Or by offering to God, and applying to that Penitent, as much of the treaſure of Chriſt, and Saints ſatisfaction and penal works as he owes.</p>
               <p>This then wee call Indulgence, <hi>A remiſson of the temporal pains due of man to God's juſtice, through the merits and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt and his Saints applied to him.</hi> Which Indulgence and application of thoſe merits and ſatisfaction, wee ſay is in the power of the Pope; for thoſe ſuperabundant ſatisfactions and penal works of Chriſt and his Saints, being a treaſure of the Church, and appliable to the vſe and benefit of the faithfull, as we have diſcourſed; to whom ſhould the diſtribution, of that treaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, but to the Prince, Chief Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Governor of the Church; to him to whom the keyes were given to open and lock, to bind and unbind? Nor are theſe Indulgences appliable only to the living, but alſo to the Soules departed; for, as when one is in priſon for a debt, for to get out, and the creditor to be indemnified, the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:97770:169"/> Priſoner muſt pay the debt out of his own purſe, or ſom one muſt pay it for him: ſo when a ſoule departs this life, either with Venial ſins only, or without having don pennance ſufficient for the mortal ſins forgiven him by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he muſt pay to Gods juſtice the temporal Puniſhment which he ows, and this is don either by <hi>Satispaſsion</hi> ſuffering the pains of Purgatorie for a certain time; or by the ſuffrages and penal works of the Living which they apply to him; or by Indulgence, applying from the treaſure of the Church, that's of the ſuperabundant Satisfaction of Chriſt and his Saints, as much as will anſwer to the pains which they are to ſuffer there.</p>
               <p>It's certain, the Pope muſt have a cauſe, and as ſom ſay proportionable to the quantity of the Indulgence he grants; for want of which, the grant would be null; which gives occaſion to our Adverſaries to ſnarle, as our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall does, againſt the profuſneſs of the Pope, for granting Plenary Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for euery triflle, as they ſay: but in this they ſpeake immodeſtly, and temerariouſly; firſt becauſe it's an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable

               <p>Our D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> reflexion, that theſe grants are a powerfull means to facilitat ſins, is vulgar, and anſwered in my former Treatiſe, where I ſhewed how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Principles do much more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litat them, wheras they require no
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:97770:170"/> more for to be cleans'd of them, but a <hi>Lord have mercy vpon me</hi> betwixt the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and God; when to the contrary for a good Confeſſion, ſo many things are required by vs; and for obtaining In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, beſides Confeſſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; alms, prayers, and other pious exerciſes: all the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> has beſids in his diſcourſe of Indulgences, is but rallery, and ſport vpon our Diviſions of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and a <hi>Bull</hi> of Indulgences, granted by Clement the X. which he has tranſlated into Engliſh, lykely to oblige the <hi>Coffie</hi> houſe Maſter, with a ſubject of merriment for his Cuſtomers: and it may be feared, that in time our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> may give his profane Reader more ſport; for if, as Ochinus, of a Capuchin Fryar became a Reformed, and from the Reformation paſs'd to be a Jew, and ſeveral other revolted Prieſts and Fryars, of Calviniſts, became Turks and Jews; if I ſay our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſhould chance, as he renounced the Catholic faith, to renounce alſo Proteſtancy for Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm or Judaiſm, he will as eaſilie ieer the practices and Doctrin of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, as now he does them of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>

               <p>IN his 31. Chap. of prayers in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen language, he points his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſo vnfixedly, that we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> know not what he would be at; ſomtimes he would have it to be abſolutly needfull, the <hi>Lyturgie</hi> ſhould be in a language vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the people; leaſt they may anſwer <hi>Amen</hi> to a knave, who would vtter blaſphemies: and not a ſillable does he anſwer to my reply, that if the Lyturgie muſt be in a language vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Auditory; then the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> who do not vnderſtand Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, muſt not go to the Proteſtant Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie; and the Deaf, and ſuch as are at ſo great a diſtance from the Miniſter, as not to hear him, muſt quit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; nay if the Miniſter does not vnderſtand the pſalms, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricatneſs of their Phraſes (and but few Miniſters do) he muſt return home and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:97770:171"/> ſom of the neighbours, more learned than he, muſt officiat for him.</p>
               <p>Somtimes he pretends only a greater advantage and Spiritual comfort of the flock, for the increaſe of devotion in praying in a knowen language; but the way for to prove this, would be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world, that Proteſtants are more devout than Roman Catholics; and I thank God the world is convinced of the contrary: ther's nothing more ſure, than that the frequent vſe of prayers, is a mark and ſign of devotion in praying; ther's none more aſſiduous in praying, than he who feels ſpiritual comfort, and conſolation in them; he who finds but tepidity and coolneſs, praies but ſeldom: now, it's viſible, our Catholic Church praies a hundred fold more than yours: you meet in your Churchs but vpon Sundaies, and ſom other od daies in the year; the other daies of the week, your Churchs are ſhut vp; or if open, they ſerve but for a walking place, or for boyes to plaie at Ball: and if in ſom few Citties, a few Churchs are open, (and they are but very few) for Wedneſday and friday prayers, your congregations are ſo thin,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:97770:172"/> that ther's hardly any to anſwer <hi>Amen</hi> to the Miniſter; Our Congregations are numerous every day in the week, our Churchs very many conſtantly open, frequently aſſiſted, not onely by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Clergy, eſpecially in the Cathedral Churchs, and Convents of Fryars and Nuns, morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at midnight ſinging Gods prayſes; but by a numerous multitude of our Layety: is not the Pomp and Majeſtie of Divin ſervice in our Church, our frequent Proceſſions, our many holy daies, a mark that wee pray more frequently than you? and a frequent cuſtom of praying, being a viſible mark of devotion, as I have ſaid; its Viſible our Church and flock has more devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Latin, than yours in Engliſh.</p>
               <p>I proved prayers in any language to be lawfull in itſelf; becauſe the intent of nature when wee ſpeake, is that the hearer may vnderſtand vs; when wee pray, God is our Hearer, and not the congregation; its to him wee ſpeake; and wheras he vnderſtands all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, wee may pray in any: Our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> fancies, that this argument proves directly againſt me; <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaies he,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:97770:172"/> 
                  <hi>the Lyturgy is an exchange of ſpeech betwixt God and his people; he ſpeakes to them in the Epiſtle, Ghoſpel and pſalms; and the people are the Hearers; they ſpeake to God in prayers, and thanks giving: Gods ſpeech therefore muſt be in a language vnderſtood by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are the Hearers:</hi> But S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> tho the Ghoſpel, Epiſtles, and pſalms be Gods ſpeech to the people, I hope you will not ſay, its a prayer of God to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to what purpoſe then do you bring this inſtance? for the queſtion now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated is, <hi>If Prayers muſt be in a knowen language:</hi> But ſaies he, tho it be not a Prayer of God to the people, its an exhortation of his, and I confeſs, with S. Paul, that the exhortations to the people muſt be in a language knowen to them becauſe they are the <hi>hearers:</hi> Neither in this do you hit right D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>; God is not the immediat inſtructor of the people; he inſtructs and exhorts vs by the Miniſters and Paſtors of the Church; the Ghoſpell therefore, Epiſtle, leſſons, and pſalms in the Lyturgie, are not properly Gods exhortation to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but a ſubject and matter for the Paſtor or Miniſter for an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the people; and for to prove
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:97770:173"/> this its enough, that beſides the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, you have in your Churchs, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and exhortations when you meet on the Sabaoth day; its needleſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Epiſtle, Goſpel, leſſons, and Pſalms be in a knowen language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not intended in the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy for an immediat exhortation to the people; but for a Subject or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Miniſter to exhort vpon: its evident they are a part of the Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which is a prayer of the people to God; the peoples prayer as wee proved may be in any language; becauſe God, who is the Hearer, vnderſtands any: therefore the Epiſtle, Ghoſpel, leſſons and pſalms may be in any language the Church pleaſes. And it is preſumption in any privat Perſon, as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Sall,</hi> or in any particular Province or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to alter the language preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the Church vnder pretence of a ſpiritual advantage or increaſe of devotion; the Church, and not any privat Perſon or Gongregation, being the guide and Miſtreſs which God has appointed, as we have proved, for to teach vs, what rites, ceremonies and manner of Worſhip we are to ſerve
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:97770:173"/> him with: but our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaies, its an abſurd thing, that J. S. ſhould pretend wee ſhould ſubmit our judgments in this to the Church, <hi>our preſent buſineſs,</hi> quoth he, <hi>being to check the abuſes of the Church:</hi> and juſt ſo will the Preſbiterians and Quakers anſwer, its a ridiculous thing in the Proteſtants to aſk them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves with the Church of England, becauſe their buſineſs is, to check the abuſes of that Church.</p>
               <p>In his 32. Chap. he pretends to prove its cruelty to forbid our common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from reading Scripture, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies the happineſs his flock reapes from the contrary practice; and ſaies not a word to this purpoſe, but what I refuted in my former Treatiſe: but alas! the lamentable effects of this arbitrary reading and interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are but too viſible; and he might have better called it the ſparke of Hell fire, which kindled and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves the combuſtions of our Church and ſtate, than our Obedience to the Pope: his vulgar reproach of our Diviſions and diſtinctions of Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, among Dominicans, Franciſcans, and Jeſuits, is not worth the taking
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:97770:174"/> notice of; it was want of matter for to fill his Chapter made him ſtoop to ſo trivial an inſtance.</p>
               <p>His attempt in his 33. chapt. againſt the Immaculat Conception of the B. Virgin, is no more, than what he ſaid in his Sermon and I refuted in my former Treatiſe: The words of S. Auguſtin quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me to prove the obligation of confeſſing, not only every ſin wee are guiltie of, but the circumſtances of time, place, and qualitie of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with whom wee commit them, ſtarrles him: he will not believe I have the leaſt tincture of a Divin, or that I am acquainted, or was ever bred among learned men of the Roman Church; and very reſolutly ſaies, that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins teach, its not the duty of a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to confeſs the circumſtances of time, place and quality of the perſons, wherin and wher with the ſin was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: and no man of judgment will ever aſk a better proof for to believe, that our Doctor never was a <hi>Profeſſor of Moral Divinity,</hi> nor that he ever read any of their works, or if he did, that he had not the memorie of a Chick to retain what he read: for he might have
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:97770:174"/> met in Alexan. 3. p. q. 32. art 2. Anton. 2. p. tit. 9. c. 7. Roſel. Verbo Confeſſio. n. 7. and in ſeveral other ancient Authors, that a ſin committed in the Sabaoth day, takes a particular malice againſt the Virtue of <hi>Religion,</hi> from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the time: becauſe its a profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a day conſecrated to the Worſhip of God; and ought to be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in Confeſſion: this Doctrin is now abſolet: but as to the circumſtances of the place and qualitie of the Perſons, it has been allwaies, and is ſtill the Doctrin of all Divins, that there is an obligation of Confeſſing them; It's theft to ſteale out of a Merchants ſhop; but its a ſacriledge to ſteale out of a Church; nor will you ſatisfie the dutie of a Penitent by ſaying you ſtole; if you do not mention that you ſtole out of a Church. Its Murther to kill, but if you kill a Prieſt, its a ſacriledge, and you muſt expreſs it in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: but I do not wonder our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſhould not minch, nor chaw theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of ſins and circumſtances; ſince he is becom of the Church of England, acuſtomed for ſo many years, to plunge its hands in the blood of the Clergy,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:97770:175"/> and ryfle Altars and Churchs, without any diſtinction of Perſons, or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>His 34. Chapt. is a Spring tide of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which in ſmale ſhowers he povred out againſt me in every chapter of his book; to which my anſwer will be ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and that patience to which Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are obliged by the example of him who being brought as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, was dumb before his ſhearers and opened not his mouth. He flatters himſelf with the opinion of ſom Divins of his Church, who ſay, the Vows he made of Povertie, Obedience, and Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie in the Roman Church, nor the Precepts of that Church do not oblige him now, ſince he is a Proteſtant; and the ſame he ſaies pag. 181. againſt J. E. in his firſt part againſt N. N. and for this he gives two reaſons; firſt he ſaies, he has demonſtrated evidently he cannot keep thoſe Vows and Precepts of the Church of Rome, without infringing them of God, becauſe they are oppoſit: But in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe I have ſhewen this to be fals; for there is no Divin Precept commanding vs to have a good Pariſh to have Rents,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:97770:175"/> honors and dignities: ſince therefore you have made a ſolemn vow of having no Rents, no Honors, no Pariſh, but to liue in pouertie; how can you ſay this vow does not oblige you? with what Diuin precept is the complyance of this vow inconſiſtent? allow the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Church of hearing Maſs does not oblige you, becauſe in it we adore the Hoſt; allow alſo your vow of Chaſtitie, is not conſiſtent with S. Paul's counſel of marrying, rather than to burn; becauſe you may find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience you cannot contain; but againſt what Divin precept or counſel is it, to ſay your Divin Office, <hi>Matins</hi> and <hi>Laudes</hi> euery day? why do not you obey this Precept of the Church? with what Divin Precept is the faſt of lent, the faſt of fridaies and Saturdaies incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent? why do not you obſerve theſe Precepts of the Church? particularly that your own Proteſtant Common Prayer book exhorts you to theſe faſts.</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon, becauſe thoſe vows he made, and his Obedience to thoſe Precepts, were grounded vpon a blind Obedience to the Pope of Rome,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:97770:176"/> including a diſobedience to Gods laws; and conſequently the vows are Null: But I have ſhowen his vows, and thoſe Precepts include no diſobedience to God's law: and I will ſhew, tho he made thoſe vows vnder the Pope, yet now, forſaking the Pope, he muſt ſtick to the vows: for I aſk you D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, are not you ſtill bound to the Duties of a Prieſt (whateuer that duty be) tho it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Popes Obedience you received your Prieſt hood? are not you, I ſay, ſtill a Prieſt? can you diſown your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, becauſe you receiued it vnder the Pope? and why can you diſown your other obligations contracted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pope; if you cannot ſhow they are inconſiſtent with Gods Laws? you were vnder the Obedience of the Pope, it's true, when you made a vow of Pouertie, Chaſtitie and Obedience; but it's not the Pope commanded you to make them; it was a free voluntarie act of your own, and therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you liue vnder the Popes Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or not, you remain ſtill obliged, as you remain ſtill a Prieſt and with the obligations of a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Remember that Paſſage of <hi>Ananias</hi>

Peter; it was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie free action of their own; this oblation (whether it vas a vow of pouertie or not) obliged them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and they tranſgreſſed againſt the holy Ghoſt, by detaining a part of that which they had ſacrific'd to God: whether Peter, vnder whom they liued when they made this oblation, was <hi>Pope</hi> or not; <hi>ſupream h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:97770:179"/> and alms of the people; no other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of your great (as you imagined) Talents, but to preach ſomtimes and teach the Catechiſm, commonly to poore people; wandring vp and down to friends houſes, to pick vp a liuelyhood; ſomtimes wellcom, and ſomtimes not; to fare at other mens tables, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ill, and ſomtimes well; ſomti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes decently clad and ſomtimes your pouertie not affording you to be ſo: your allurements beſids this, was to ſay your Breviary dayly for about an hours time; an hours meditation or mental prayer euery morning; beſids other devotions which you were obliged by your Rules to perform; to faſt in Lent, Fridaies and Saturdaies, and glad to hit ſomtimes on bread and milk or butter; other corporal auſterities, if you ſatisfied your dutie; continual feare of impriſonment or baniſhment; an abnegation of your own Will to the conduct of your Superiors command againſt your inclinations; theſe were the allurements you had to be of that Religion; ſee whether ambition or ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice could have a ſhare in the choice of ſuch a life and Religion: you tell me
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:97770:180"/> you will never again return to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that you will continue in Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy; and truly if nothing but Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Avarice and worldly allurements gouern you actions, your are far better where you are, and will do very ill to return where you were; the allurements are ſtrong for your continuance in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancie; you have a good Pariſh with good rents, and Judas betrayed his Maſter for a ſmaler intereſt; inſteed of milk and eggs on faſting dayes, you have a good peece of beef and better cheer, and are not beholding to your neighbours, (if you pleaſe) for you may have a table of your own; you have neither Breviary, nor beads nor meditation nor Maſs to trouble your reſt, but may ſleep eat and drink at will and pleaſure, and inſteed of an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of poore people, you can preach in Chriſt Church, and have acceſs to great ones: theſe indeed are ſtrong (but earthly) allurements to keep you in Proteſtancy, and bid a figg for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
